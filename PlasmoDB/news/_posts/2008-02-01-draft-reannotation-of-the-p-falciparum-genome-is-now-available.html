title: Draft Reannotation of the P. falciparum genome is now available.
category: [PlasmoDB]
---

The effort to re-annotate the <i>falciparum</i> genome was started in October at a weeklong workshop co-organized by ApiDB and GeneDB staff.  The workshop was hosted at the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK and was attended by nearly 30 <i>Plasmodium</i> researchers contributing expertise in various aspects of <i>Plasmodium</i> biology and more than 10 bioinformatics support staff from the GeneDB and ApiDB teams. More than 2,700 genes have been reviewed to date and most modified in some fashion; primarily refining exon boundaries, assigning product names, assigning GO functions and EC numbers and making comments / notes.  The annotation process is continuing in the attempt to review all genes at least twice (by different annotators).  The annotation presented here in PlasmoDB is thus a work in progress and intended to inform you, the community, about the new annotation and elicit any feedback that you may have.  Please add a user comment to any gene that you have additional information about.  This includes supporting data corroborating gene annotation as well as data that indicates the gene model, product name, functional assignments etc are incorrect.  These comments will be included in the annotation which we hope will be concluded in mid-march.
