title: Important announcement regarding microarray data in PlasmoDB
category: [PlasmoDB]
---

Dear all,<br>
<br>
The PlasmoDB team would like to alert you to two important issues
concerning the presentation of <span style="font-style: italic;">P.
falciparum</span> microarray data in PlasmoDB.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; Beginning with PlasmoDB 6.0 all profiles using the
Winzeler Affymetrix scrMalaria array were updated to reflect the latest
3D7 genome annotation. Previously, probes were mapped to the P.
falciparum 3D7 genome annotation released in July 2001.&nbsp; The
array was originally designed with a tiling of probes, so the new
annotation has resulted in many genes gaining new probes which did not
previously map to the gene, and dropping old probes which no longer map
(Note: The new mapping allowed up to two mismatches per probe, and only
probes which mapped uniquely, up to two mismatches, were
retained).&nbsp; Previous gene expression profiles were generated
using the MOID algorithm with the 2001 annotation, while the current
profiles were generated using RMA with the new annotation.&nbsp;
Many of the expression profiles exhibit minor differences and a
few&nbsp;changed significantly.&nbsp; Such differences are
expected and should result in a more accurate representation of the
data.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; An internal error with one the files concerning the P.
falciparum 3D7 gametocyte expression data was discovered.&nbsp;
This error appeared with the release of PlasmoDB 6.0 in July of 2009
and was fixed on October 20th, 2009.&nbsp; Also, please note that
probe remapping and MOID vs. RMA analysis differences described above
also apply to this data set.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We regret any disruption this may cause you.&nbsp; Please do not
hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
The PlasmoDB Team
