title: Verson 2 of P. falciparum IT is now available on GeneDB!
category: [PlasmoDB]

<div align="justify">
A new assembly of the P. falciparum IT genome is now available,
replacing the version 1 sequence that has been available via PlasmoDB
(since release 8.0) and the Sanger FTP site. The version 1 sequence was
produced by "correcting" (or morphing) the reference 3D7 sequence,
using aligned Illumina reads from IT.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in version
2, the sequence data have been assembled de novo. A key aim for this
genome project is to fully assemble the subtelomeric regions. Although
we were able to correctly assemble some subtelomeric sequences onto the
“core” of the genome (i.e. the interstitial or housekeeping region),
many subtelomeric sequences remain problematic and are being actively
refined. The annotation is automated and no manual curation has taken
place.<br>
<br>
The new version contains new systematic identifiers compliant with
those now in use for 3D7.&nbsp; However, old identifiers remain in the
database as fully searchable synonyms.&nbsp; The new version can be
viewed and searched on GeneDB and will be loaded into PlasmoDB in early
2012.&nbsp; EMBL and GFF format files can be downloaded from the
following FTP site:<br>
