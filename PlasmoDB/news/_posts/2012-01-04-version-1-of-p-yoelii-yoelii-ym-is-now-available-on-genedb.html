<div align="justify">
A first-pass assembly and annotation of <i>P. yoelii yoelii</i> YM is now publicly available on GeneDB. The assembly was made 
using short-fragment Illumina reads and scaffolded with 454 paired-reads from a 3kb library. The assembly was 
computationally improved using PAGIT (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/pagit/) and annotated by transfer 
from the <i>P. berghei</i> ANKA reference. Genes in subtelomeric regions were predicted <i>ab initio</i>. The annotation has been 
manually re-inspected genome-wide.<br><br>
<i>P. yoelii yoelii</i> YM can be viewed and searched on GeneDB.  EMBL and GFF format files can be downloaded from the 
following FTP site:<br><br>
<b>ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Plasmodium/yoeliiYM/version_1/January_2012</b><br><br>
A publication describing the new sequence is in preparation and permission should therefore be obtained before undertaking 
genome-scale or whole chromosome wide analyses.<br><br>
This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the European Union's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) 
under grant agreement no 242095. The DNA was provided by Tony Holder (Division of Parasitology, MRC National Institute for Medical 
Research, Mill Hill, London).
