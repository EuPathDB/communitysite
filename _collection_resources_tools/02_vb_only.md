<h2>Welcome to the new VectorBase <I>beta</i> website!</h2>

<p>Welcome.  VectorBase <i>beta</i> has a new look and new tools to help you better browse and query vector omics and population data.  Feel free to review the other <b>Overview of Resources and Tools</b> cards to learn more.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org">legacy vectorbase.org</a> site is still available to help you transition to the new site, if needed.</p>

<p>To view a summary of the datasets available for each species, follow this link in the header menu <a href="/a/app/search/organism/GenomeDataTypes/result">Data => Organisms - Data type summary</a> </p>

<p>We will start to incorporate new data sets in the second half of 2020.  Please let us know if you wish to submit a data set or make us aware of one relevant to your research, to help us prioritize our list.</p>

<p>If you have questions, want to give feedback, have ideas about the new site, need help or have any other issues, email us at <a href="/a/app/contact-us">help@veupathdb.org</a> or fill one, two or all three surveys found <a href="/vectorbase.b47/app/static-content/VectorBase/news.html#VectorBase47Releasedhere">here</a>
