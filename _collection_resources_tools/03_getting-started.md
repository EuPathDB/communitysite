VEuPathDB is packed with data, tools and visualizations that can help answer your research questions.  We gather data from many sources, analyze according to standard workflows, and present the results for you to mine in a point and click interface. Here's a little on how to get started:<br><br>

<b>SITE SEARCH</b>: Find what you need<br>
   <p class="indent">Enter a term or ID in the site search box at the top of any page.  The site search returns a categorized list of records that contain your term.  It's easy to find genes, data sets, pathways, searches and more with the site search.<br>

   </div>
   </p>
<b>SEARCH STRATEGY SYSTEM</b>: Discover meaningful biological relationships from large volumes of data<br>
   <p class="indent">The strategy system offers over 100 structured searches that can be combined to produce multi-step strategies. Each search queries a specific data set and returns a list of records that share the biological characteristic defined by the data. To run a search, navigate to one from the Search For... menu, adjust the search parameters if desired, and then click Get Answer.  Your results are presented in the My Strategies section.  <br>
