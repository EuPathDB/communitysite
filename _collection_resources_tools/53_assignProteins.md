<div style="margin: auto; max-width: 51em;">
  <p>If you have a set of proteins (like an entire proteome) and want to discover orthologs in other species as well as protein function, use a pre-configured workflow in VEuPathDB's Galaxy to assign proteins to OrthoMCL groups. This workflow uses BLASTP and the OrthoMCL algorithm to assign your set of proteins to groups. </p>
<p>To assign proteins to groups:
<ul>
<li>Prepare a FASTA file of proteins that you would like to map to OrthoMCL groups</li>
<li>Create an account with OrthoMCL if you do not have one already</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="/a/app/galaxy-orientation">Assign Proteins to Groups</a> page</li>
<li>Navigate to Galaxy and follow the instructions to upload your FASTA file</li>
<li>Run the OrthoMCL Galaxy workflow</li>
</ul>
