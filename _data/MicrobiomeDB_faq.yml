  question: "Why was MicrobiomeDB created?"
  answer: |
           High-throughput sequencing has revolutionized microbiology by allowing scientists to complement culture-based approaches with culture-independent profiling 
           of complex microbial communities. Whether studying these communities in soil, on plants, or in animals, the collection of community composition data is often 
           accompanied with rich metadata that describes the source from which the sample was derived, how samples were treated prior to collection, and how they were processed after collection. 
           Increasingly, the goal of microbiome experiments is to understand how these various attributes represented by the metadata, influence the microbial community. 
           **MicrobiomeDB was developed as a discovery tool that empowers researchers to fully leverage their experimental metadata to construct queries that interrogate microbiome datasets.**

  question: "How is the database populated?"
  answer: |
           MicrobiomeDB uses an automated pipeline for loading raw fastq files from microbiome experiments carried out on the Illumina or 454 'pyrosequencing' platforms. 
           Raw sequences from each study are processed using [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) and the [Silva database](https://www.arb-silva.de/) of high quality ribosomal RNA sequences
           In addition to loading taxonomic data, MicrobiomeDB loads all 'metadata' terms used by the experimenter to describe each sample. 
           These terms are mapped to the MIxS ontology and unmapped terms are manually curated and used to expand a custom, MIxS-compliant, ontology tree. 
           This rich, structured sample description generates an ISA.tab file that is then loaded into microbiomeDB. 
           When combined with the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure developed by VEuPathDB, 
           the user is provided with an web interface to interrogate complex, even massive-scale, microbiome studies using metadata queries. 
           The resulting queries are then visualized using a suite of Shiny apps available directly in the browser.

  question: "Does the site handle shotgun metagenomic data?"
  answer: |
           If you have a .biom file from your metagenomic study, then you can upload this directly to MicrobiomeDB under the Workspace menu (see next FAQ below).
           We do not yet handle loading of raw sequence files from metagenomic studies, but this is one of our future goals. 
           Although the datasets currently loaded in the site are from 16S rDNA marker gene sequencing, 
           we are working on adding functionality for handling 'shotgun' metagenomic sequence data, 
           potentially allowing interrogation of community composition at the species or strain level, 
           looking at other organisms in complex communities (e.g. fungi and prokaryotes), 
           as well as identification of samples based on the relative abundance of bacterial genes (e.g. antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, etc.). 
           Taken together, our goal is to develop a full-featured, open-source platform for a systems biology view of microbial communities.  
           If you are interested in analyzing your own shotgun metagenomic data, check out the tools available at **[NIAID's Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/index)** resource.

  question: "Can I privately analyze my own unpublished data using the tools on MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           Yes! Simply register for a free account, and you'll have access to your own Workspace were you can upload **[.biom files](http://biom-format.org/)** from 16S or shotgun metagenomic studies.  
           A .biom file can be produced from standard 16S data processing pipelines, such as Mothur and QIIME.
           When creating your .biom file, be sure to incorporate metadata from your samples. 
           If you are using QIIME to analyze your 16S data, be sure to take a look at [our QIIME2 protocol](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-16S-data-using-QIIME2-f225c95e34784cc3b726cff2d4d137cc). 
           Instructions for generating a .biom file with metadata included are in the 'OPTIONAL: export .biom file' step in the protocol.
           If you're looking for web-based access to QIIME or MOTHUR, you may be interested in the tools available at **[NIAID's Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/index)** resource for preprocessing and analysis of 16S rRNA marker gene data.

  question: "How are datasets chosen for loading into MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           Several things factor into our decision to load a dataset.  
           First, we have a strong interest in studies of the microbiome in infant and materal/child health and in enteric diseases.  
           Second, we're also interested in understanding how different animal models (mice, dogs, pigs, etc) might help us understand the role of the microbiome during health and disease.  
           Finally, we're interested in multifactorial and longitudinal datasets, since these qualities of datasets provide a unique opportunity to employ data mining and visualization to reveal interesting associations.

  question: "Where can I find additional information for the large epidemiological studies you have loaded on MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: 
           Several of the studies available on MicrobiomeDB, including the [GEMS1 Case Control study](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593), [MAL-ED 2yr](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_9d44f0a9b5), and [MAL-ED diarrhea](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_71c725321c)
           are all part of large studies where rich clinical and epidemiological data were collected from thousands of participants across multiple countries.
           For each of these studies, only a subset of participants had samples collected and processed for microbiome analysis.  Moreover, the sample metadata available on MicrobiomeDB for these studies includes only
           what was made available in the publication describing the results from the microbiome study.  Additional sample- and participant-level clinical and epidemiological data (often times extensive)
           are available for these participants and many more participants at our partner site, [ClinEpiDB.org](https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/).
