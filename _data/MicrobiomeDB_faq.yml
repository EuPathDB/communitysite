  question: "Can I analzye my own unpublished data using the tools on MicrobiomeDB?'"
  answer: |
           Sorry, but this feature isn't available yet.  However, we're working hard to develop a user workspace that would allow you to upload **[.biom files](http://biom-format.org/)**.  You can also 
           **[Contact Us](https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/contact-us)** to inquire about having your own 
           data (published or unpublished) loaded into the site for public access!

  question: "How are datasets chosen for loading into MicrobiomeDB?'"
  answer: |
           Several things factor into our decision to load a dataset.  First, we have a strong interest in studies of the microbiome in infant and child health and in enteric diseases.  Second, we're also interested in understanding how different animal models (mice, dogs, pigs, etc) might help us understand the role of the microbiome during health and disease.  Finally, we're interested in multifactorial and longitudinal datasets, since these provide a unique opportunity to data mining approaches to reveal interesting associations.

  question: "How do I cite MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           If you want to cite MicrobiomeDB directly, please use:

           > Oliveira FS, Brestelli J, Cade S, *et al.*; MicrobiomeDB: A Systems Biology Platform for Integrating, Mining and Analyzing Microbiome Experiments. *Nucleic Acids Research* 2018 (<https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1027>{:target='_blank'})

           When citing a dataset that you accessed via MicrobiomeDB, please include the dataset authors, 
           study name, date of release and release number on MicrobiomeDB, study page URL, and the fact that 
           the data came from MicrobiomeDB. For example, the citation for the PRISM Cohort study would be:

           > Pop M, *et al.* Study: GEMS1 Case Control. *MicrobiomeDB*. 2020; release 17(<https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593>{:target='_blank'})

           You can find the information on the study page by clicking the study name on the homepage 
           or on the dropdown 'Search a study' menu. The study name, release number, and release date 
           are at the top of the page, while authors are listed in the 'Principal Investigator and 
           Collaborators' table at the bottom of the page. You can also find links to original study 
           publications, which you may want to cite.

  question: "Can I access the code used for MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: 
           Yes! Our code can be found on **[Github](https://github.com/VEuPathDB?q=microbiome&type=&language=)**, 
           and we welcome input from the community. Check out our **[Shiny app scripts](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/MicrobiomeWebsite/tree/master/View/lib/R/shiny/apps)** or the code we use for running a **[DADA2-based automated data loading workflow](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/DJob/tree/master/DistribJobTasks/bin/dada2)**, which processes fastq files for all the studies on MicrobiomeDB and produces taxonomy tables that are represented on the site.
