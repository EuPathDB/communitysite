  question: "How do I cite ClinEpiDB?"
  answer: |
           When citing a dataset that you accessed via ClinEpiDB, please include the dataset authors, name, date of release on ClinEpiDB, study page URL, and the fact that the data came from ClinEpiDB. 

           For example, the citation for the PRISM Cohort study would be:
           <div class='indent'>Dorsey G, Kamya M, Greenhouse B, <i>et al.</i> 'Study: PRISM Cohort.' <i>ClinEpiDB</i>. 2018. <a target='_blank' href='https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/record/dataset/DS_0ad509829e'>https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/record/dataset/DS_0ad509829e</a></div>

           All the information can be found on the study page. 
           To access the study page, click the name of the study on the homepage or on the dropdown 'Search a study' menu. 
           Authors are listed in a table at the bottom of the page in the 'Principal Investigator and Collaborators' table, while the study name and release date are at the top of the page. You can also find links to original study publications on the study page, which may want to cite.

           If you want to cite ClinEpiDB directly, please use:

           Ruhamyankaka E, Brunk BP, Dorsey G <i>et al.</i> 'ClinEpiDB: an open-access clinical epidemiology database resource encouraging online exploration of complex studies.'
