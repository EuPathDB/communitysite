  question: "How do I cite ClinEpiDB?"
  answer: |
           If you want to cite ClinEpiDB directly, please use:

           > Ruhamyankaka E, Brunk BP, Dorsey G *et al.* ClinEpiDB: an open-access clinical epidemiology database resource encouraging online exploration of complex studies. [version 1; peer review: 2 approved]. *Gates Open Res* 2019, 3:1661 (<https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13087.1>{:target='_blank'})

           When citing a dataset that you accessed via ClinEpiDB, please include the dataset authors, 
           study name, date of release and release number on ClinEpiDB, study page URL, and the fact that 
           the data came from ClinEpiDB. For example, the citation for the PRISM Cohort study would be:

           > Dorsey G, Kamya M, Greenhouse B, *et al.* Study: PRISM Cohort. *ClinEpiDB*. 2018, 5 (<https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/record/dataset/DS_0ad509829e>{:target='_blank'})

           You can find the information on the study page by clicking the study name on the homepage 
           or on the dropdown 'Search a study' menu. The study name, release number, and release date 
           are at the top of the page, while authors are listed in the 'Principal Investigator and 
           Collaborators' table at the bottom of the page. You can also find links to original study 
           publications, which you may want to cite.

  question: "How do I submit data?"
  answer: |
           To start, you should [Contact Us](/a/app/contact-us){:target='_blank'} to inquire about 
           having your data loaded into ClinEpiDB. Tell us about the study objectives and design, 
           the size of the dataset, types of variables, and your funding source. Then, check out our 
           [Data Submission Guidelines](/documents/ClinEpiDBDatasetGuidelinesforDataProviders.pdf){:target='_blank'} 
           to learn more about how to prepare your data for us and what additional files we need. 
           If we are able to integrate your data, we'll give you access to a secure Box folder where 
           you can upload your data and accompanying files.

  question: "How does ClinEpiDB protect human subject data?"
  answer: |
           1. We ask all users to agree to our [Data Access and Use Policy](/documents/DataAccessUsePolicyClinEpiDB.latest.pdf){:target='_blank'}
           2. Direct identifiers such as names and GPS coordinates are removed for all studies. Dates are obfuscated, locations are generalized, and additional indirect identifiers are removed or obfuscated as needed on a case-by-case basis. For some studies, subject IDs are re-assigned to break the link to the institution’s copy of the data
           3. Data access restrictions are implemented as needed (see [Data Access and Use Policy](/documents/DataAccessUsePolicyClinEpiDB.latest.pdf){:target='_blank'})

           forms and your IRB proposal. Our [IRB data sharing guidance](/documents/IRBDataSharingGuidance.pdf){:target='_blank'}
