  question: "How do I do an enrichment analysis on a list of genes by GO term or metabolic pathway?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (link), or all the genes in a given organism (link)
           1. click “Analyze results"
           This will give you the option to run a variety of analyses on your list of genes
           See the following worksheet to learn more: [GO enrichment](https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/GO-Enrichment.pdf)

  question: "How do I transform a list of genes into homologs in a different organism?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (link), or all the genes in a given organism (link)
           1. Click "Add a step"
           2. Choose "Transform"
           3. Click "Orthologs"
           4. Locate the species/strain that you want to transform your list of genes, into and tick it
           5. Click "Run Step"
           You will now have a list of genes in the new species (A) and corresponding list of homologue(s) in the input species (B).

  question: "Download genomic or amino acid sequences (one gene)?"
  answer: |
           Start with list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (link), or all the genes in a given organism (link)
           1. From the gene page of your gene of interest, select “Download Gene
           2. Select “FASTA”
           3. Select what kind of sequence you want
           4. Select the region of sequence you want to download including sequences upstream and downstream of the coding region. Instructions at the bottom of the download page will guide you.
           5. Click "Get Sequence"

  question: "How do I share my strategy /list of genes with someone else?"
  answer: |
           Ensure you are logged in first
           1. Click on the share icon
           2. If necessary, you will be prompted to save your strategy before you can share. Click the share icon again.
