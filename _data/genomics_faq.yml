  question: "How do I do an enrichment analysis on a list of genes by GO term or metabolic pathway?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (link), or all the genes in a given organism (link)
           1. click “Analyze results"
           This will give you the option to run a variety of analyses on your list of genes
           See the following worksheet to learn more: [GO enrichment] (https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/GO-Enrichment.pdf)

  question: "How do I transform a list of genes into homologs in a different organism?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (link), or all the genes in a given organism (link)
           1. Click "Add a step"
           2. Choose "Transform"
           3. Click "Orthologs"
           4. Locate the species/strain that you want to transform your list of genes, into and tick it
           5. Click "Run Step"
           You will now have a list of genes in the new species (A) and corresponding list of homologue(s) in the input species (B).

  question: "How do I share my stragey /list of genes with someone else?"
  answer: |
           Yes! Each study is assigned their own stable identifier that begins with 'DS_'. This identifier is present in all URLs associated with that study, including the Study page. For more information on how to cite the data for a study loaded in ClinEpiDB, see [How do I cite ClinEpiDB?](#g2)
