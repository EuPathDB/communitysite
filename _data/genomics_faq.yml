  question: "How do I do an enrichment analysis on a list of genes by GO term or metabolic pathway?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (see above), or all the genes in a given organism (see above)
           1. click “Analyze results"
           This will give you the option to run a variety of analyses on your list of genes
           See the following worksheet to learn more: [GO enrichment](https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/GO-Enrichment.pdf)

  question: "How do I transform a list of genes into homologs in a different organism?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy, a list of genes you submit (see above), or all the genes in a given organism (see above)
           1. Click "Add a step"
           2. Choose "Transform"
           3. Click "Orthologs"
           4. Locate the species/strain that you want to transform your list of genes, into and tick it
           5. Click "Run Step"
           You will now have a list of genes in the new species (A) and corresponding list of homologue(s) in the input species (B).

  question: "How do I share my strategy /list of genes with someone else?"
  answer: |
           Ensure you are logged in first
           1. Click on the share icon
           2. If necessary, you will be prompted to save your strategy before you can share. Click the share icon again.
           A link will be provided that you can share.

  question: "How do I download a sequence in FASTA format from a region of interest in JBrowse?"
  answer: |
           1. Make sure the “annotated transcripts” and the “reference sequence” tracks are turned on
           2. Click on the “highlight a region” button in the navigation bar. It should turn yellow when activated
           3. Click and drag in the genome view region and select the area you would like to highlight (tip: highlight region from within annotation track)
           4. Click on the down arrow on the reference sequence track and select “Save track data”
           5. In the next popup window you can keep everything as the default and either save or view the sequence

  question: "How do I add a restriction site to JBrowse?"
  answer: |
           In JBrowse
           1. Select “Add sequence search track” from the Track menu
           2. Enter the enzyme sequence in the popup
           3. The location of the sequence will now show up in the browser.  The cool thing is that you can add multiple tracks with sequences that you define

  question: "How to cite a gene? Why we recomend gene stable ID in addition to gene metadata"
  answer: |
           Gene metadata are the gene name or symbol and the gene functional description. The gene stable IDs are, not only stable (as implied by their name), also easier to work with, as you can upload them in GLORIA WORK IN PROFGRESS ...
