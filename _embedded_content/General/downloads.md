<h3>There are several kinds of downloads available in a EuPathDB site:</h3>
<div id="cirbulletlist" class="eupathdb-content">
<ul>
<li> Download files that we create at release time. The link to access these files is under the menu item "Downloads":"Data Files". These include fasta files for all available sequences, gff files with complete gene information, and other formats.
<li> Download files with results generated by running searches. From a result page (after running a search) a user can access the "Download Results" link, to a new page where a few different download formats are offered. The file for download includes all IDs in the result. The user selects a format and, in some formats, the user may request additional information about each ID in the result: single valued attributes (e.g., exon count for a geneID) and multi-valued tables (e.g., set of EC numbers for a geneID).
<li> Download fasta files from the Sequence Retrieval Tool,  under the menu item "Tools":"Sequence Retrieval".
<li> Download files that have been uploaded by the community in our websites, available under "Downloads" or "Community".
<li> Downloadable EuPathDB publications, under the menu item "Downloads".
</ul>
