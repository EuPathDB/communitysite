      <section> <h3><b>New Data in this Release</b></h3>
		<ul>
        <li>The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), coordinated by the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development, was a case-control study conducted at seven diverse, high-burden sites in Asia and Africa: the Gambia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The study enrolled 22,568 children under 5 years of age. GEMS is the largest, most comprehensive study of childhood diarrheal diseases ever conducted in developing country settings.  Results showed that most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Truly a groundbreaking study in childhood infectious disease, the initial GEMS1 Case-Control data, including TaqMan Array Card molecular detection results, are now available on <a href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_841a9f5259">ClinEpiDB.org</a>. Exploring the data using the search wizard and analysis applications are open to all users; in order to download the data, investigators will be required to register and submit a data access request. About 1000 stool samples from GEMS1 have 16S sequence data available; results and more information about those samples can be found at our companion site <a href="http://microbiomedb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593">MicrobiomeDB.org</a>. In the coming months, the GEMS1A and heathcare utilization surveys that were conducted in concert with GEMS will also be made available.
