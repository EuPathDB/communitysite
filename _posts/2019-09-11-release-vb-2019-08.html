<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded">We are pleased to announce the August 2019 release of VectorBase (VB-2019-08):
<ul>
<li>Please note, this release has deviated slightly from our usual two-monthly schedule. Since this is the last release of the current funding cycle, we decided to delay by a few weeks in order to load as much data as possible, thus pushing the release into September.  For consistency and technical reasons the release is still tagged VB-2019-08."
</li>
<li>The PopBio map has been improved with extra "available data-types" functionality in Sample View legend, and in Abundance View, users can now filter on GPS data quality</li>
<li>New PopBio data: 40 years of Des Plaines Valley Mosquito Abatement (Illinois) surveillance data, also surveillance data from Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Montana, and North Dakota (all six sates in the USA)</li>
<li>New variation data sets for <a href="/Culex_quinquefasciatus/Info/Index"><i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i></a> from the publication <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269040?dopt=Abstract">"Using targeted next-generation sequencing to characterize genetic differences associated with insecticide resistance in Culex quinquefasciatus populations from the southern U.S.", Kothera et al, PLoS One. 2019 Jul 3;14(7)</a>, and two sandflies - <a href="/Lutzomyia_longipalpis/Info/Index"><i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i></a> and <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/Phlebotomus_papatasi/Info/Index"><i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i></a> from the Sandfly Genome Consortium.</li>
<li>The current ensembl genome browsers for VectorBase species will be supported in <a href="http://metazoa.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl metazoa</a> from the December 2019 e99 release onwards. Older versions of the genome assemblies for <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> L3 assembly will only be available from the Ensembl metazoa archive site.</li>
<li>Splice junction files have been updated for all species. To access this data via Apollo use the "Select tracks" menu and you will see the updated splice junction tracks grouped in the "Summary tracks" category.</li>
<li>Data on proposed alterations to 21 <i>Anopheles</i> superscaffold assembles using gene synteny based methods (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/434670v3.full">"Evolutionary superscaffolding and chromosome anchoring to improve Anopheles genome assemblies", Waterhouse et al, bioRxiv, 2019</a> ) have been added to the <a href="/downloads?field_download_file_format_tid=1579&field_status_value=Current">downloads</a> section. The proposed updates to the current assemblies for these species have not been incorporated into the current VectorBase databases, but have been made available as tar files for researchers to work with during the period of time that <a href="/news/important-vectorbase-merge-eupathdb">VectorBase and EuPathDB conduct their merger</a>.</li>
<li>Updates to documentation includes the page <a href="/content/submit-data"><u>'Submit Data: Data types and submission procedures'</u></a> and the FAQs <a href="/faqs/how-cite-vectorbase"><u>'How to cite VectorBase?'</u></a> and <a href="/faqs/how-cite-gene#"><u>'How to cite a gene?'</u></a> </li>
<li> A new FAQ <a href="/faqs/csiro-and-vectorbase"><u>(which includes seven questions)</u></a> has been added related to VectorBase (PopBio) collaboration with CSIRO</li>
</ul>
