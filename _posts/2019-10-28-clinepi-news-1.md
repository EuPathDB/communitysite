New Data in this Release
The South Asia ICEMR surveillance study was coordinated by the Malaria Evolution in South Asia (MESA) International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR). The health-center surveillance study enrolled over 1500 participants in Goa, India to observe the clinical severity of malaria cases and identify correlates with parasite phenotypes and genotypes. Additional data from Wardha, Maharashtra; Ranchi, Jharkhand; and the northeast region (Assam, Tripura and Arunachal states) will be released in the coming months.
The Amazonia ICEMR longitudinal cohort study was coordinated by the Amazonia International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (Amazonia ICEMR). The study enrolled over 2400 participants across two study areas, Cahuide and Lupuna, in the Peruvian Amazon with the objectives of estimating the incidence and prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection, risk factors and potential for transmission, and risk of reinfection and development of clinical disease, among others.
