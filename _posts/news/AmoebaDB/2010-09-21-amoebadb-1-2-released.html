<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of AmoebaDB 1.2<br>
<br>
<br>
This release of AmoebaDB includes the following new data set:</span><span
style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
</span>
<ul>
<li>Proteomics data from <span style="font-style: italic;">E.
histolytica </span>phagosomes of various degrees of maturation
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211552/">Boettner
et. al.</a>).&nbsp; This data can be searched in AmoebaDB from the <a
href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByMassSpec">Mass
Spec. search page</a> and results can be integrated with other search
types.&nbsp; An example search strategy that integrates different
search types can be viewed <a
href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/im.do?s=3a0c08bd343b2607">here</a>.&nbsp;
This strategy asks for all <span style="font-style: italic;">E.
histolytica</span> genes&nbsp; with phagosome proteomic evidence, that
contain transmembrane domains and&nbsp; contain a "kinase" PFAM
domain.&nbsp; <br>
</li>
<li>Gene that have evidence of protein expression also have a
graphical representation of the peptide hits on their respective gene
pages (mousing over the graphics provides additional information such
as peptide sequence).&nbsp; Here is a link to a gene page with
proteomics evidence -- scroll down to the "Protein" section and show
"Protein features".&nbsp; Note that samples are color coded.<br>
</li>
<li>Proteomics data can also be visualized in the genome
browser.&nbsp; This <a

shows a 200Kb genomic region with the gene models and proteomics track
turned on.&nbsp; <br>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New features in this release include:</span><br>
<ul>
<li>The search strategy window is now resizable.</li>
