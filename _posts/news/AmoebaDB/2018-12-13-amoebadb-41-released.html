      <h4>Introducing Clustal Omega </h4><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
      EuPathDB sites are now using Clustal Omega for gene page protein alignments in the 'Orthologs and Paralogs within EuPathDB' table and the 
      'Retrieve multiple sequence alignment or multi-FASTA' tool in the 'Orthology and synteny' section of gene pages. The 'Isolate Alignments in this Gene Region' tool 
      still uses CulstalW.  
       </div> 
      <h4>New Gene page tools </h4>
         <ul>
           <li>Interpro  &mdash; <br>
              The 'Protein features and properties' section now includes an option to submit the protein sequence for 
              sequence analysis and classification via <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/" target="_blank">InterPro</a>. 
          </li>
          <li>GPI anchor prediction  &mdash; <br>
              The 'Protein features and properties' section now includes an option to submit the protein sequence for 
              GPI modification site prediction via the <a href="http://mendel.imp.ac.at/sat/gpi/gpi_server.html" target="_blank">GPI Lipid Anchor Project</a>.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
