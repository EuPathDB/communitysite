<p><strong>We are pleased to announce the release of AmoebaDB 48.</strong><br><br>  The product of 6 months of back-end infrastructure work, Release 47 includes <a href="https://beta.amoebadb.org" target="_blank">beta.amoebadb.org</a> in addition to our legacy sites. The beta site contains the same data as the legacy site but also has new tools and functions in an updated and streamlined interface that emphasizes easy access to tools and help information.  For example, the search functionality in the header now performs a site-wide search.</p>

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
