  <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A News section and Twitter newsfeed have been added to our homepage to make update announcements easily accessible.</li>

    <li>Protecting the data of research investigators and study participants is important to us. We have updated our 'Data Access and Use Policy' to reflect the different levels of data access offered to data providers and users. Please contact us for more information about how data access restrictions are implemented on ClinEpiDB.</li>
    <li>In our 'Tutorials and Resources' section we have added a document that provides quick guidance for researchers when considering the complete lifecycle of data. It includes links to data sharing resources and some template language for putting together consent forms, IRB proposals, and amendments.</li>
