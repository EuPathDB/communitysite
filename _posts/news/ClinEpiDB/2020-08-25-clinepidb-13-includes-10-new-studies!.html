    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul style = "max-width:500px; word-wrap:break-word;">
       <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">We've made it easier to find studies of interest! From the "Search a Study" drop down menu, you can access the <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/search/dataset/Studies/result">All Studies</a> table which now has additional, sortable columns with information on the study design, number of participants, and more. Click the "Add/Remove Columns" button to see all options.</li>
       <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">It's now easier for you to cross-reference variables to the original study data dictionaries. Just look for the "Provider label" under the variable name. These labels are also searchable! Available for half the studies now, expect to see them for all studies in our next release.</li>
    </ul>

  <section> <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul style = "max-width:500px; word-wrap:break-word;">
      <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">We are releasing 5 new datasets from SCORE- the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation. Two datasets are from cluster-randomized field trials of mass drug administration:
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; font-size:90%">
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_4d0fe88b6b">SCORE Niger <i>S. haematobium</i> Cluster Randomized Trial</a> investigated six possible combinations of mass drug administration in Niger. The relative reduction of prevalence was greater in biannual compared with annual treatment across all arms, however, the only significant difference was seen in areas with a high starting prevalence.</li>
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_cb9893494e">SCORE <i>S. mansoni</i> Kenya and Tanzania Cohort</a> was a nested cohort study conducted within SCORE's intervention trials to monitor changes in a suite of schistosomiasis disease outcomes. The conclusion was that programs using annual community-wide treatment are likely to achieve better overall <i>S. mansoni</i> morbidity control than those implementing only biennial school-based treatment.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The other three SCORE datasets are from diagnostic studies comparing the standard Kato-Katz stool test to the point of contact CCA urine test.
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; font-size:90%">
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_6b79157ec1">SCORE Five Country CCA Evaluation Cross-sectional</a>:  SCORE supported the evaluation of a commercial point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) test for assessing <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> infection prevalence in areas at risk in 5 countries- Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda and concluded that one urine POC-CCA test can replace Kato-Katz testing for community-level <i>S. mansoni</i> prevalence mapping.</li>
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_88b591c3e5">SCORE Rwanda Mapping Cross-sectional</a> and The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_55fd455f5e">SCORE Burundi Mapping Cross-sectional</a>: SCORE supported the mapping of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> prevalence in Rwanda and Burundi to determine the feasibility of moving toward elimination in these two countries using two detection methods: a test detecting a schistosome antigen in urine (CCA) and a test to detect parasite eggs in stool (KK). The results indicate that <i>S. mansoni</i> infection is still widespread in Rwanda and Burundi.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">We have three new studies conducted by different International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMRs), which span the globe from India to Uganda to Brazil:
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; font-size:90%">
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_cbd9087ebc">India ICEMR Severe <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>falciparum</i> Cohort Study</a> was coordinated by the Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi). 51 participants with severe malaria who were admitted to the hospital were followed until discharge to assess the morbidity, outcomes, and management of severe <i>P. vivax</i> malaria compared to severe <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria.</li>
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_51b40fe2e2"> Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda 2 (PRISM2) Study</a> follows the original <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_0ad509829e">PRISM Study</a> in Tororo District, Uganda, where many participants were re-enrolled from PRISM to PRISM2. The new longitudinal study, conducted by the East Africa ICEMR, aims to estimate the incidence and prevalence of <i>Plasmodium</i> infection, characterize factors that determine the malarial force of infection, and duration, density, and clinical consequences of blood stage malaria infection, and estimate transmission intensity.</li>
          <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_8e1f623542">Amazonia ICEMR Brazil Cohort Study</a> was conducted by the Amazonia ICEMR. Over 600 participants were followed every few months to estimate the prevalence and incidence of asymptomatic <i>Plasmodium</i> carriage, characterize risk factors for clinical disease and gametocyte carriage, and more in rural Amazonia.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_22e3c3c070">Kalifabougou Malaria Cohort Study</a> is another longitudinal malaria study conducted in Kalifabougou, Mali by researchers at the NIH in conjunction with researchers at the University of Bamako, Mali. This release contains clinical and sample data for >1000 participants from 2011-2018. The study is ongoing, so expect to see additional data releases in the future!</li>
      <li style ="padding-bottom: 0.5em">The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_fe95d702c3">Performance of Rotavirus and Oral Polio Vaccines in Developing Countries (PROVIDE) Study</a>, coordinated by researchers at the University of Virginia and icddr,b, is a randomized controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design that investigates the efficacy of oral rotavirus and polio vaccines in children under 5 in Bangladesh.</li>
