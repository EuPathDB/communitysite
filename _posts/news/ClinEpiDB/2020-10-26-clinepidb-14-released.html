    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_21205ebb16">India ICEMR Behavior Cross-sectional study</a> was coordinated by the Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi). Roughly 500 participants were surveyed in 2017 to investigate behavioral aspects of malaria risk in villages with medium (2-10%) or high (>10%) rates of malaria prevalence.</li>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_7c4cd6bba9">The LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP)</a> was a cluster-randomized trial embedded in the Ugandan National Malaria Control Program's 2017-2018 long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) national distribution campaign. 104 health sub-districts were randomly assigned to receive LLINs with piperonyl butoxide or conventional LLINs. Cross-sectional surveys were performed in 5200 households per timepoint at baseline 6, 12, and 18 months after LLIN distribution to assess parasite prevalence in children.</li>
