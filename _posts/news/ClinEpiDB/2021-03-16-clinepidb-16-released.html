    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
       <li>We've made it easier to find a specific study! We realized the list of studies we have just keeps getting longer, so we added a search bar to the top of the "Search a Study" drop down menu so you don't have to scroll to find the study that you're interested in.</li>
       <li>For studies with data access restrictions in place, we now publish the total number of data access requests they've received to date, the number of requests approved, and the percent approved. Find this information in the "Data Access Statistics" table on the study page or add it as columns on the "All Studies" page.</li>
