CryptoDB is now part of an NIH/NIAID funded Bioinformatics Resource Center 
        to provide Apicomplexan Database Resources. This release represents a major 
        upgrade of the database software and as a result we can provide greater 
        search power. We now offer searches by gene and contig name in addition 
        to key word and protein features. Results are displayed graphically and 
        provide additional useful information for each gene or contig. We have 
        added a GBrowse display that allows you to zoom in to the nucleotide level 
        and we have added a comparative GBrowse view comparing <i>C. parvum</i> 
        and <i>C. hominis</i> contigs. Please explore the site and provide feedback 
        and suggestions to <a href="mailto:help@cryptodb.org">help@cryptodb.org</a>.
