CryptoDB is one of NIAID's Bioinformatics Resource Centers (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/brc/default.htm">BRC</a>)  for Biodefense and Emerging or Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases. As part of our efforts for interoperability among the other BRCs and the research community in general we have released the published <i>Cryptosporidium</i> genome features in standardized GFF3 format. The files may be downloaded via FTP from <a href="ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/brc/ApiDB/Cryptosporidium/">ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/brc/ApiDB/Cryptosporidium/</a>.
