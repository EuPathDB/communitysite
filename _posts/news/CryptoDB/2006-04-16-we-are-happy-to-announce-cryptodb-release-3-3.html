title: We are happy to announce CryptoDB Release 3.3
category: [CryptoDB]
---

New in this release:
<ul>
<li><b>New Gene Annotations</b>
    <ul><li>
411 additional gene annotations have been made by CryptoDB for the <i>C. parvum</i> genome. These correspond to the genes annotated in the Genbank record simply as "introns and exons likely".
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>PFam Predictions</b>
    <ul><li>
    interproscan was used to query <i>C. parvum</i> and <i>C. hominis</i> annotated proteins against the PFam component of <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/index.html">InterPro</a>. A query to find genes by PFam family name has been added and predicted domains are documented on the gene record pages.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Gene Ontology Terms</b>
    <ul><li>
<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">GO terms</a> were collected from the interproscan analysis and are available for gene searches and are documented on the gene record pages.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>EC Numbers</b>
    <ul><li>
EC number annotations have been added. Sources of EC numbers include Genbank, KEGG and the metabolic pathway database CryptoCyc. Genes may be searched by EC number.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Gene Orthologs</b>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <i>C. parvum</i> and <i>C. hominis</i> orthologs computed at <a     href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/">OrthoMCL DB</a> have been added to our database. </li>
    <li>We have added <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByOrthologPattern&amp;go.x=12&amp;go.y=4&amp;go=go">query</a> to find <i>Cryptosporidium</i> genes that have a specified phyletic pattern, based on ortholog groups. </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Analysis for MRC-LMB's chromosome 6</b>
    <ul><li>
    <i>C. parvum</i> chromosome 6 completed by Bankier, et al., MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology has undergone our in-house analysis. This includes DNA and protein sequences searched against NCBI's non-redundant protein database and protein queries against the PFam database.
    </li>
    </ul>
