title: NIAID funds Cryptosporidium muris genome sequencing project
category: [EuPathDB,VEuPathDB,CryptoDB]
---

The <b><i>Cryptosporidium muris</i> genome sequencing project</b> has been funded by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases (NIAID), through the
Microbial Sequencing Center program at the Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR). This project aims at obtaining a high-quality assembly of <i>C. muris</i>
genome based on 8X sequence coverage, as well as the comparative automated
and manual curation of gene structure predictions of all three
<i>Cryptosporidium</i> genomes sequenced to date. More information is 
available on the project's website
(<a href="http://msc.tigr.org/c_muris/index.shtml">http://msc.tigr.org/c_muris/index.shtml</a>).
All sequence reads and traces will be deposited with GenBank and the genome
assemblies and annotations will be deposited with GenBank and CryptoDB.
