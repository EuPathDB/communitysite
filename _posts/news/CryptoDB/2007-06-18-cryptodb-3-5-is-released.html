New data and queries in CryptoDB 3.5:
<ul>
  <li>Proteomics data provided by two labs (Wastling, et al. (updated from CryptoDB 3.4) and Snelling, et al. (new data)) have been loaded, and 
    these are visible on the Genome Sequence Browser. Queries to find genes, or ORFs, that show evidence of protein expression based on Mass Spec analyses are also available.</li>
  <li><i>C. muris</i> contigs from first draft assembly and translated open reading frames.</li>
  <li>Interproscan analysis of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> proteins.</li>
</ul>

  New features in CryptoDB 3.5:
</p>

<ul>

<li>We have added <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showXmlDataContent.do?name=XmlQuestions.Tutorials">tutorial movies</a> to help you learn about the functionality of our site. 
If there are additional tutorials you would like to see added please submit a request via our <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">support page</a>.</li>

<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
</li>

<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
</li>

<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
  </li>
  <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including protein structures, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
  </li>
  <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  </li>
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool).
  </li>
  </ul>
