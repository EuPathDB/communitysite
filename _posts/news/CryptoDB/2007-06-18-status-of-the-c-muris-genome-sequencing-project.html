title: Status of the C. muris Genome Sequencing Project
category: [CryptoDB]
---

A preliminary assembly of <i>C. muris</i> was obtained at approximately 
         4.5 X coverage, and
reveals a ~9Mb genome with average cytosine-guanine content (%GC) of ~28.5
%. This assembly is based on ~50,000 reads obtained mostly from a
small-insert library and a fosmid library. This assembly is estimated to
contain ~ 92% of the ~9Mb genome, and consists of 927 contigs arranged into
595 scaffolds.
<p>
Final assembly, to be released in late summer, will include an additional 2X
coverage obtained from a medium insert library and possibly >5X additional
coverage obtained with 454 pyrosequencing technology. The final assembly is
expected to contain > 99% of the genome.
<p>
Sequencing from the cDNA library provided by Giovanni Widmer is underway.
Average insert length is 1,600 bp. If the library is shown to be random, an
expected >30,000 EST reads will be obtained.
