category: [CryptoDB]
---

The ApiDB team is pleased to announce the release of CryptoDB 3.7
<p>
New features include:
    <ul>
	<li>records for 756 <i>Cryptosporidium</i> isolates. Queries are available for searching isolate records by ID,  
host of origin, isolate species, and several other characteristics.  
For the full set of search options, see the "Identify Isolates by:"  
category on the web site's front page. Multiple isolate sequences can  
be readily aligned with ClustalW from the query result page.
<li>also included are 27,498 <i>C. muris</i> oocyst ESTs aligned to the <i>C. muris</i> 
draft genome.
<li>alignments of contigs of <i>C. parvum</i>, <i>C. muris</i> and <i>C. hominis</i> have been  
remade using the Mercator orthology mapping program and the MAVID  
multiple global alignment program. These alignments are available in  
the Genome Browser.
    </ul>
