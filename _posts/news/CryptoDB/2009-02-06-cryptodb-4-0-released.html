We are please to announce the release of CryptoDB 4.0, which features 
       several new data sets (including many that were graciously provided 
       prepublication to CryptoDB) and enhancements.

       New data data sets:
       <ul>
         <li> The fully sequenced and annotated genome of <i>Cryptosporidium muris</i>.</li>
         <li> More Isolate data -- CryptoDB now includes 2290 isolate records.</li>
         <li> New proteomics data for <i>C. parvum</i>.</li>
       </ul>
       New features and enhancements:
       <ul>
        <li> Improved text search capability providing scored results.</li>
        <li> Improved result summary pages that also include results filtered against all <i>Cryptosporidium</i> in CryptoDB.</li>
        <li> A dramatically revamped isolate query section.  In particular, this includes a vastly improved organization of isolates to allow more useful queries.  Our Geographic location query now includes a map to allow visualization of isolate location by country or continent.</li>
        <li> Blast can now be performed against reference isolates only which should facilitate typing.</li>
        <li>  Reference RFLP gel images are now made available via CryptoDB (a link from the isolate section).</li>
        <li>  We now provide a phylogenetic tree view of multiple sequence alignments from isolate sequence that you choose.</li>
        <li>  Several additional queries have been implemented including queries for secondary structure (based on sequences in the Protein Data Bank or PSIPRED), isoelectric point and available antibodies (in the reagents section). </li>
        </ul>
        *We are grateful to several investigators who have provided data and advice for this release of CryptoDB including:
        <ul>
