<br> 
This release of CryptoDB contains new expressed sequence tag (EST) data 
for Cryptosporidium parvum KSU-1, normalized sporozoite and pooled 
normalized enriched 24-48hr post-infection. &nbsp;EST data can be 
searched in many ways, such as by <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=EstQuestions.EstsBySimilarity">BLAST</a>,
<a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=EstQuestions.EstsByLibrary">library</a>, <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=EstQuestions.EstsWithGeneOverlap">extent of gene overlap</a>, etc.
&nbsp;Additionally, genes can be searched <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByESTOverlap">based on EST evidence</a>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br> 
<br> 
New Features:</span><br><br>
<ul> 
 <li>The gray tool bar at the top of all CryptoDB web pages has 
been enhanced to include a link to the "My Basket" feature including an 
indication of how may items are in the basket.</li> 
 <li>The genome browser has been updated to version 1.7, which 
offers enhanced features and stability.&nbsp;Now you can select a span and send the sequence to ncbi for blasting!</li> 
 <li>Weighted searches are now available. &nbsp;This feature 
allows you to assign an arbitrary weight to the searches (steps) in 
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list 
of your results.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul>
