        <h4>FPKM Floor parameter in RNA-Seq fold change searches</h4>

           now offer an <b>FPKM Floor</b> parameter for adjusting the FPKM value of low expressing genes. To avoid 
           misleading fold change values generated by dividing with very small numbers, we set very low FPKM values to a default <b>FPKM floor</b> which represents
           10 mapped reads. The new parameter offers a range of floor values for raising or lowering the expression threshold of the search 
           depending on the user's objectives. For more information use the parameter help (blue question mark icon) on the search page or read the 
           <a href="/assets/Fold_Change_Help.pdf">detailed RNA seq search help</a>.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
