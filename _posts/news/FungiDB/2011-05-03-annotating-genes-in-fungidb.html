title: Annotating genes in FungiDB

A <a href="http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2011/05/annotating-genes-in-fungidb/">short blog post at the Hyphal Tip</a> is up to demonstrate how comment pages can be used to add annotation for a gene record page. This is useful way to allow community annotation, registering of gene names, and linking of publication and sequence records to gene pages. The comments page can also be used for listing negative results (e.g. "Knockout has no phenotype") and describing gene model improvements (e.g. "Intron 3 is wrong, the correct exon locations are Chr3: 1020-1401, 1521-1703").
