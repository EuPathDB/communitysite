<p><h4>Community Outreach Specialist</h4></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eukaryotic Pathogen Database resource (EuPathDB.org) seeks to hire a community outreach specialist with a focus on fungal biology. The outreach team (three plus members) works collaboratively within a larger ~30-member team of biologists, annotators, user-interface and software developers to provide effective data representation and online resources to scientists and clinicians worldwide who utilize the highly-visible EuPathDB websites.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sites include those for malaria-causing parasites (PlasmoDB.org), trypanosomes (TriTrypDB.org), fungi (FungiDB.org) and other pathogenic eukaryotic organisms. The overall project goal is to present our global user base with an intuitive and informative Web interface for accessing and interrogating omic-scale datasets. The successful applicant must be able to effectively communicate with scientists conducting various types of research on pathogenic eukaryotes and their close relatives in order to respond to the communities' needs and identify/acquire omic-scale datasets. Thus, effective communication and an understanding of the challenges posed by large-scale data are required. The position requires travel with active participation in scientific meetings including internationally, instruction at workshops and webinars, participation in scientific writing of abstracts, manuscripts and other material (ie. Posters, flyers and educational material), and keeping up-to-date with the pertinent scientific literature.<br><br>
One position is open in three possible locations: <br><br><a href="https://jobs.hr.upenn.edu/postings/14170">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</a><br><br><a href="https://www.ugajobsearch.com/applicants/Central?quickFind=67650">Athens, Georgia, USA</a><br><br>The United Kingdom (position to be announced soon)</p>
