       <h4>RNA Sequencing</h4>
       <aside>
         The following RNA sequencing data was originally loaded into FungiDB in Sept 2013 but erroneously 
         contained several <i>A. nidulans</i> samples that were aligned to N. crassa.  The <i>A. nidulans</i> data 
         and <i>N. crassa</i> data are now two separate data sets in FungiDB.

                       Inducer-Free Cellulase Secretion in <i>Neurospora crassa</i></a> &mdash;
            Global mRNA abundances from liquid cultures of <i>N. crassa</i> were measured by sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx 
            and HiSeq2000 platforms. Cultures were harvested at 4 hours, after a switch to media of interest.

       <h4>New Tutorials</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/z6c_FhMCdPo">Exploring expression distributions with our Percentile Ranking searches</a> - 
            Percentile ranking is one way that EuPathDB analyzes expression data.  This tutorial 
            describes our percentile ranking of expression data and the searches that we offer based on that analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Yk9kkaPAmAE">Finding Differentially expressed genes based on Fold Change with a P-value</a> - 
            One way EuPathDB analyzes expression is to determine statistically significant differential gene expression using the  
            Fisher's exact test. This tutorial describes our Fold Change w/ P-value searches that return differentially 
            expressed genes based on the level of statistical confidence that you choose.

        <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
        Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
        When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
        When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
