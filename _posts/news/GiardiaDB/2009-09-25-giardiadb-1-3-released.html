<b>We are pleased to
announce the release of GiardiaDB 1.3</b><br>
<br>
<u>New Data:</u><br>
<ul>
  <li><i>G.
intestinalis</i> mitosome enriched fraction proteomics
provided by Jan Tachezy and described in <a
 href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717741">Rada <i>et. al.</i></a></li>
  <li><i>Giardia</i>
isolate data from GenBank are now included -- search for isolates based
on many criteria such as geographic location, submitter name, isolation
source and/or host. &nbsp;Also, generate nucleotide sequence
alignments of isolates you select, and BLAST your sequence against the
isolate database. <br>
   </li>
</ul>
<u>New/Updated
Features:</u><br>
<ul>
  <li>Now after you perform a BlastN against genomic sequence you
can
link from the blast output to the correct coordinates in the genome
browser.&nbsp; This allows you to explore annotation and other
functional
data in relation to your BLAST hits.</li>
  <li>A table of paralogs (if any) is now available on gene pages
allowing you to view expanded gene families -- See <a
 href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/app/record/gene/GL50803_15158">GL50803_15158&nbsp;</a>for
example (scroll down to the Orthologs and Paralogs Table).</li>
  <li>The type ahead feature has been implemented for GO term, EC
number and Interpro domain searches.</li>
  <li>You can now edit or delete your user comments.</li>
  <li>You can now modify your user profile, change your password
or your email address.</li>
</ul>
Please also note that the parent portal site <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a> has just been
updated, offering you the ability to explore results across organisms.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
The EuPathDB team.
