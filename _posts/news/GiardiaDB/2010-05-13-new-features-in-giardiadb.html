<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce new features in Giardia 2.1<br>
<br>
<br>
In an effort to continue improving the utility of GiardiaDB </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">we have
implemented several new features in recent releases. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for putative secreted enzymes. &nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/im.do?s=11cea73c70d44e95">Putative
secreted enzymes (unweighted)</a><br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/im.do?s=525c3842824cc776">Putative
secreted enzymes (Weighted)</a></div>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> allows you to bookmark and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">community
annotation</span> field has been added to the text
search page. &nbsp;This makes it possible for the Giardia research
community to provide expert bulk annotations that would ultimately
results in changes in the GenBank record and official annotation.
&nbsp;Currently, there are 164 community annotations provided by
Rod Adam concerning VSPs. &nbsp;To view community annotations go to
the text search page in GiardiaDB and limit your search to the
"Community annotation".&nbsp; To view all genes that have a
community annotation associated with them simply enter the wild card
"*" in the text search field.&nbsp; The annotation itself is
prominently displayed on the gene pages right under the product name.
&nbsp;You can also click on the comment ID to retrieve additional
information.</li>
  <li>A file including <span style="font-weight: bold;">assignment
of contigs to chromosomes</span> has been made available by
Hilary Morrison pre-publication in the community file section of
GiardiaDB. &nbsp;<a
 href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/communityDownload.do?fname=opticalmap_placement.xls.txt">Links</a>
to the file are available on all contig pages.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>
