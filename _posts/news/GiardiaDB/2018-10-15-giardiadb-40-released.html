      <h3><b>New features in GiardiaDB 40</b></h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <h4>New Sense/Antisense RNA seq search</h4>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalGeneDatasetQuestions.GenesByRNASeqEvidence">RNA Seq searches</a> &mdash; <br>
           A new Sense/Antisense search for exploring strand specific transcription is available for any strand specific RNA sequence data set.  
           For each gene, the search compares the fold change in sense reads to the fold change in antisense reads and returns genes that 
           have simultaneous changes in sense vs antisense expression between two samples. Versatile search parameters allow for choosing 
           the direction and magnitude of the change in sense and antisense transcripts.  The search result page lists genes and indicates 
           the paired Reference->Comparison samples that meet the criteria, and offers two graphs to help interpret 
           the search results (FPKM vs sample bar graph, antisense FC vs sense FC scatter plot)

         <h4>New Gene page tools </h4>
         <ul>
           <li>Protein alignment tool &mdash; <br>
              The Orthologs and Paralogs within EuPathDB
              table now includes an option to run protein ClustalW alignments on orthologs.  Use the 'Protein clustalW' column to include orthologs in 
              the aligment and click 'Run clustalW for selected genes' to initiate the alignment.  For more information see this
              <a href="/assets/ClustalWonGenePage.pdf">ClustalW tutorial</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Protein-protein BLAST tool &mdash; <br>
             The Protein features and properties
             data section now includes an option to BLASTP the protein sequence against 8 data bases including Non-redundant protein sequences (nr), 
             Reference proteins (refseq_protein), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (swissprot), Model Organisms (landmark), Patented protein sequences(pat), 
             Protein Data Bank proteins(pdb), Metagenomic proteins(env_nr), and Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly proteins (tsa_nr).  For more information see this 
             <a href="/assets/RunningBlastP.pdf">BlastP tutorial</a>.
          </li>
          <li>MitoProt tool &mdash; <br>
             The Protein features and properties 
             data section now includes an option to retrieve mitochondrial prediction data from  
             <a href="https://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html" target="_blank">MITOPROT: Prediction of mitochondrial targeting sequences</a>. Clicking 
             the gene page MitoProt tool Submit button initiates a query of the protein sequence in MitoProt and opens a new tab 
             populated with the prediction results. For more information see this 
             <a href="/assets/RunningMitoProt.pdf">MitoProt tutorial</a>.
          </li>
          <li>WoLF PSORT tool &mdash; <br>
             The Protein features and properties
             data section now includes an option to retrieve predictions of protein subcellular localization sites from  
             <a href="https://wolfpsort.hgc.jp/aboutWoLF_PSORT.html.en" target="_blank">WoLF PSORT</a> based on amino acid sequences. Choose an 
             Organism type and click Submit to initiate a query of the protein sequence in WoLF PSORT and open a new tab 
             populated with the prediction results. For more information see this 
             <a href="/assets/RunningWoLFPSORT.pdf">WoLF PSORT tutorial</a>.

      <!--   
         <h4>New Gene Result Analysis tool</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>A new tool to find 'Experiments with Similar Results' is available for any gene result.  Use the blue 'Analysis 
           Result' tab on any gene result page to access the tool.  The tool compares the genes in your current result to 
           gene lists generated from each transcriptomic data set based on GSEA. The tool returns a list of @PROJECT_ID@ data sets whose 
           gene lists are statistically similar and may be worth investigating. For more information, see this 
           <a href="/assets/XXXX">Sense/Experiments with Similar Results tutorial</a>.
           </li>
         </ul><br>
       -->  
         <h4>New Galaxy tool and workflow</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>Map Your Proteins to OrthoMCL Groups workflow &mdash; <br>
           EuPathDB Galaxy now includes a preconfigured workflow for mapping proteins to OrthoMCL groups. The workflow 
           uses BLAST and the OrthoMCL algorithm to assign your set of proteins to OrthoMCL groups.
           Access the  workflow from the EuPathDB Galaxy home page under 
           'Get started with pre-configured workflows'. The workflow employs three tools which can be accessed 
           separately in the EuPathDB Galaxy tools menu under EuPathDB OrthoMCL Tools. This workflow duplicates 
           and replaces the 'Assign your proteins to groups' function in the Tools menu of the 
           <a href="http://orthomcl.org/orthomcl/" target="_blank">OrthoMCL site</a>.
           For more information see this 
           <a href="/assets/MapProteinsOrthoMCL.pdf">OrthoMCL proteome upload tutorial</a>.
           </li>
           <li>RNA-Seq to EuPathDB export tool &mdash; <br>
           EuPathDB Galaxy now includes a tool for exporting the results of your RNA seq analysis to any EuPathDB site. The tool transfers 
           bigwig and FPKM text files to your private My Data Sets page on EuPathDB. From the My Data Sets page the files 
           are available for GBrowse visualization and the Search Strategy system.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
