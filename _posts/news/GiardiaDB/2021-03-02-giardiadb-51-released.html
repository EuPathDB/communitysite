  <h3>New data in {{project}} 51</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>EBI Pipeline</h4>
    {{project}} 51 represents the first release that employs the EBI pipeline for analyzing genomes and RNA-Seq data. (<a href="/a/app/static-content/methods.html">{{project}} Analysis Methods</a>) All genomes were run through the EBI pipeline, updating all analyses such as InterproScan and repeat identification.  While much of the EBI pipeline is the same as our previous in-house pipeline, these differences are noted:
    <ul>
      <li>Expression values calculated from RNA-Seq data are now presented as TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) instead of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) or RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million). <a href="https://rna-seqblog.com/rpkm-fpkm-and-tpm-clearly-explained/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></li>
      <li>Signal peptide predictions are now made with <a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-4.1/" target="_blank">SignalP-4.1</a>, updated from <a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-3.0/" target="_blank">SignalP-3.0</a>.</li>
    </ul>

   <ul>
    <li><a href="/a/app/workspace/blast/new" target="_blank">BLAST<i><sup>beta</sup></i> tool</a> &ndash; a new BLAST tool with multi-BLAST capabilities.  Input a single sequence or several fasta-formatted sequences at once.  Our tool uses NCBI BLAST to find genes, genomic sequences, ESTs, or PopSet Sequences that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence.  </li>
    <li><a href="/a/app/static-content/about.html#about_use" target="_blank">Usage and performance metrics</a> for VEuPathDB sites are updated monthly in a new online document.  </li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
