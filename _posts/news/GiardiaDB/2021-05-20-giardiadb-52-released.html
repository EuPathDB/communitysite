  <h3>New features in {{project}} 52</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li>The gene pages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogene" target="_blank">pseudogenes</a> are modified to improved clarity: <a href="{{'/assets/images/pseudogene-page.png' | absolute_url}}">(helpful image)</a>
      <ul>
        <li>The Transcripts table in the Gene Models section now indicates that no protein products are produced. </li>
        <li>The exons in JBrowse views of pseudogenes are colored gray.  Blue represents genes on the forward strand and red represents genes on the reverse strand. </li>
        <li>The Orthology and Synteny section indicates that orthology is not determined for pseudogenes.</li>
        <li>Protein sequences are no longer available from the Sequences section.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reference organisms are indicated in the Organism parameter on search pages.  VEuPathDB chooses a representative genome from each species and aligns all functional genomics data to the reference.  In doing so, all data can be viewed and compared in the genome browser against the reference.  In some cases, data are aligned to the source organism in addition to the reference.

    <li>The algorithm for transferring EC Numbers between orthologs is updated. We previously predicted EC numbers, but now we offer scores and statistics to help users determine the confidence in this prediction. The new algorithm compares a gene's protein sequence to the protein sequences of other genes in the same ortholog group. A gene is inferred to receive a specific EC number based on how well its sequence matches genes in it's ortholog group that have already been assigned this EC number.</li>
    <li>Community annotations made in {{project}} via Apollo are now represented on gene pages in the Gene Models graphic. In addition, links from the gene page to Apollo are offered to facilitate community annotations. <a href="{{'/assets/images/51-apollo-news.png' | absolute_url}}">Example image.</a>  Please see our <a href="https://youtu.be/RMXZDBMh8Fo" target="_blank">Apollo webinar</a> for instruction. </li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
