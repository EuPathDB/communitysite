            <a href="http://hostdb.org/hostdb/app/record/dataset/DS_92a3bc8cb7">Transcriptomes of 4 <i>M. musculus</i> cell types during infection with <i>T. gondii</i></a> &mdash; 
            <i>M. musculus</i> cortical neurons, astrocytes, skeletal muscle cells and fibroblast transcriptomes during infection with <i>T. gondii</i> strain NTE.

      <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
      <h4>GO Slim Implementation<h4>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
          
          GO Slim terms are now indicated in EuPathDB sites in the following ways:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The search,
                <a href="http://hostdb.org/hostdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByGoTerm">Identify Genes based on GO Terms</a>, 
                now includes an GO Subset option for limiting the search to only GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>GO Terms tables on gene pages now contain a 'GO Subset' column which identifies GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>The GO enrichment analysis has an option for limiting the analysis to GO Slim terms. This will limit both 
                the background and the gene list of interest in the Fisher's exact test that determines enrichment. 
                </li>
          </ul>
       
       <h4>Revigo and Word Cloud access from GO Enrichment results</h4>
       <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
       
          HostDB offers a link between our GO Enrichment results and a Word Cloud visualization as well as 
          Revigo, a tool that provides GO term summarization and visualization. The links to Revigo and the 
          Word Cloud now appear as buttons that are right justified above the GO enrichment result table.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
