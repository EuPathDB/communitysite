        <ul>
        <li>The search box on the landing page now searches both the text on each study card, as well as the the more extensive 'study details' page.  This means that users can now easily filter cards based on principal investigator, publications, institution, and more.
        </li>
        <li>Users now have the ability to customize histogram displays for any sample detail (metadata) variable in the filtering tools, including rescaling X and Y axis, toggling between log and linear displays, and customized binning.
        </li>
        <li>The search strategy has been redesigned for a better user experience.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
