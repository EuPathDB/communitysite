        <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Users can now run complete 16S, ITS, or metagenomic workflows on Nephele (https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/) and produce a 'magic link' to your results.  This link is an authenticated URL that can be copied/pasted into the 'My Data Sets' page of MicrobiomeDB, thus allowing direct transfer of results from Nephele to MicrobiomeDB for filtering, querying and visualizing your results.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
