        <h3><b>New data in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Preterm infant resistome study, which includes both 16S and shotgun metagenomic data from a cohort of preterm infants, along with extensive details on antibiotic exposure during their stay in the neonatal intesive care unit
        </li><li>The Ecology of Cystic Fibrosis (Eco-CF) study from Columbia University Medical Center.  This study characterized the microbiome in sputum, oral cavity and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from pediatric cystic fibrosis patients.

        <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>We developed an automated data loading workflow that allows us to load shotgun metagenomic data into MicrobiomeDB.  This automated workflow uses the popular MetaPhlAn3 and HUMAnN3 for taxonomic and functional profiling, respectively.  Currently, only taxonomic data is loaded into the database, while functional profiling data is available for download via FTP site
        </li><li>Minor updates to our relative abundance and alpha diversity apps to improve UI/UX components.
        <li>We updated our FTP downloads (available through the "Download Data" link on each study card) to provide more convenient data formats for downstream analysis in spreadsheet programs or commandline tools in R or Python.  
        </li>

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
