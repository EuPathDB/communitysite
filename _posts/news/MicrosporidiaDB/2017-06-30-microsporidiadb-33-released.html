       <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3> 

           <ul>
            <li>Transcriptomics data are available for display and download from a strategy result.  For any strategy that returns genes, 
                use the Add Columns tool to display graphs and normalized expression values.  Use the Download tool to obtain expression values as a file.<br><br> 
            </li>
            <li>Improved image resolution, legend and axis text, as well as additional mouseover information for graphs on gene pages and in result columns.<br><br> 
            </li>
            <li>Gene Ontology and Metabolic Pathway enrichment analysis results now include a word cloud of enriched terms.  
                The size and color depth of GO terms or metabolic pathway names in the word cloud are based on the p-values of the enriched terms.<br><br> 
            </li>
            <li>Gene Ontology and Metabolic Pathway enrichment analysis results now include a column with for viewing the genes that contribute to the enrichment. 
                Click the number in the column, 'Genes in you result with this term/pathway', to populate the Gene ID search with the IDs of genes contributing to the 
                enrichment.  Click Get Answer to initiate the search and retrieve the list of genes.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>Galaxy workflows for variant calling are now available from the EuPathDB Galaxy site which can be reached by clicking 'Analyze My Experiment' from the 
                gray tool bar under the header. 
            </li>
           </ul>

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
