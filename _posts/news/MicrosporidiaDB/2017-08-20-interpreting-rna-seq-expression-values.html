        In the transcriptomics section of gene pages, expression graphs display FPKM or RPKM values determined from uniquely aligned 
        reads (those that align to one location only). The coverage section shows plots of unique reads aligned to the genome.  
        This may underrepresent abundance for genes that are duplicated, such as paralogs. Non-unique reads are only available 
        as GBrowse subtracks. To view non-unique reads from a gene page, open the Coverage section and click 'View in 
        genome browser' above the coverage plots.

        To view non-unique reads without navigating to the gene page, open GBrowse from the home page.  Use the Select Tracks 
        tab to turn on the data track of interest and the subtracks configuration tool to turn on the non-unique reads subtracks.

        In release 34, gene pages contain a message about non-unique reads, an accurate description of the y-axis and links to 
        tutorials on how to display non-unique reads.  Future releases will offer searches based on the non-unique reads and 
        their contribution to expression.

        For future releases, we are working to implement a graphic visualization that provides information about both unique and a non-unique reads. </div>
