OrthoMCL-DB Version 2 is released.  The new dataset includes an increased number of genomes (87).  New features on the web site include a system wide speed up; a significant speed up of the phyletic pattern query; improvements in query pages and group pages to accomodate the increased number of genomes; and use of public identifiers for sequences throughout the site, instead of assigned identifiers.  Perhaps most importantly, the production of the dataset has been moved to a pipeline system.  This will allow us to generate new versions at a much improved frequency.
