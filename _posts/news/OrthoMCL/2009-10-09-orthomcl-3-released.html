OrthoMCL-DB Version 3 is released.  The new dataset includes 128 genomes.  New web site features include: (1) a tool to assign your proteins to OrthoMCL groups (see the new tools menu);  (2) a mapping from Version 3 groups to Version 2 and 1 is available for searching, allowing you to track changes across versions;  (3) the phyletic pattern in the groups result page is configurable, so you can tailor it to the clades you are interested in.
