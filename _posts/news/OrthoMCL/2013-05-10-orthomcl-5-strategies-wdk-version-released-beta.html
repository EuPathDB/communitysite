OrthoMCL-DB Version 5-WDK (Beta) is released.  It uses the new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/strategies-wdk/">Strategies-WDK</a> based web site.  Version 6 is on the way in the first half of 2013.  It will be the first build using a new backend system that will help us get releases out at a faster rate.
