OrthoMCL Version 6.1 is released. This version employs the OrthoMCL algorithm on the proteins from a carefully-chosen set of 150 Core species to form Core ortholog groups. Significantly, the website has been engineered to assign proteins from 394 other organisms, termed Peripheral organisms, into these Core groups. All peripheral proteins that fail to map to a Core group are collected and subjected to independent OrthoMCL analysis, forming Residual groups. This design will allow us to map new proteomes at every release (every 3 months).
