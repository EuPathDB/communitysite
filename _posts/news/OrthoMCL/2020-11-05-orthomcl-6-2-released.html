OrthoMCL Version 6.2 is released. In this release, 19 <b>Peripheral</b> species were added. Thus, OrthoMCL now predicts orthology for a total of 563 organisms (413 <b>Peripheral</b> and 150 <b>Core</b> organisms). Proteins from the 19 new species were mapped into <b>Core</b> ortholog groups. Then, a new set of <b>Residual</b> ortholog groups (e.g. OG6r2_101799) were formed from the collection of all unmapped <b>Peripheral</b> proteins. See the About page for the methods.
