OrthoMCL Version 6.5 is released. In this release, 28 <b>Peripheral</b> species were added. Thus, OrthoMCL now predicts orthology for a total of 631 organisms (481 <b>Peripheral</b> and 150 <b>Core</b> organisms). Proteins from the 28 new species were mapped into <b>Core</b> ortholog groups. Then, a new set of <b>Residual</b> ortholog groups (e.g. OG6r5_101799) were formed from the collection of all unmapped <b>Peripheral</b> proteins. See the <a href="/a/app/static-content/OrthoMCL/about.html">About page</a> for the methods.
