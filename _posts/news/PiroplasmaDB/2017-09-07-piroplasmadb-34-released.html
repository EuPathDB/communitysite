          EuPathDB now offers a direct link from gene ontology (GO) enrichment results to 
          <a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/">REVIGO</a>, a tool that provides GO term summarization and visualization.  
          To access this feature first run a GO term enrichment using the 'Analyze Results' option from any gene search result. Then click on 
          the 'Start Revigo Analysis' link (<a href="/piroplasmadb/images/Revigo.png">upper right hand side of enrichment results</a>) 
          to populate the REVIGO submission page with your GO enrichment results from EuPathDB.  Follow instructions 
          on the REVIGO page to complete your analysis.

         <aside>
           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
