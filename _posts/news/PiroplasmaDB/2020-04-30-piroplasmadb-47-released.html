<p><b>This is a draft news release that will be finalized upon Release 47 approval.</b></p>

<p><strong>We are pleased to announce the release of PiroplasmaDB 47.</strong><br><br>  The product of 6 months of back-end infrastructure work, Release 47 includes <a href="https://beta.piroplasmadb.org" target="_blank">beta.piroplasmadb.org</a> 
  in addition to our legacy sites. The beta site contains the same data and previous, as well as new, tools or functions in an updated and streamlined interface that emphasizes easy access to tools and help information (check out the new search functionality in the header).</p>

<p>Underlying our website's new look is a modernized client-server architecture. After three years of planning and development, the site is now driven completely by our new <a href="/a/app/static-content/content/{{project}}/webServices.html">REST API</a>. The browser-based user interface accesses that API to get all data, and is coded using the React/Redux framework.</p>


<p>
  Your feedback is invaluable as we improve our sites and transition to our new architecture and interface.  So please try 
  <a href="https://beta.piroplasmadb.org" target="_blank">beta.piroplasmadb.org</a> and let us know how we are 
  doing by completing one or all of the surveys below.  Each takes about half an hour to complete.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
