    <li>Gene pages: The sequence section now contains links to copy the sequence to your clipboard. Sequences are copied in FASTA format with the gene ID in the def line.  </li>
    <li>Gene pages: It is now possible to scroll and zoom within the JBrowse views that are present in the 'Gene models' and 'Protein features and properties' sections. </li>
    <li>Contact Us form: A new option on the Contact Us form makes it possible to paste a screenshot into the form when sending us questions or suggestions. </li>
    <li>Search result page: The Download and Add to Basket options from a search result tab now appear as buttons for better visibility.</li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
