OrthoMCL is an algorithm developed to identify orthologs and recent paralogs based on whole genome comparison of protein sequences (Li et al Genome Res. 13:2178; 2003). Previously, OrthoMCL groups were based on comparison of only 16 species in PlasmoDB 4.4. In the current release, OrthoMCL groups were generated with 61 species. These species include the 55 used to generate orthologs groups at the <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi">OrthoMCL DB site</a> plus <i>P. vivax, Leishmania major, T. brucei, T. cruzi, Apis mellifera</i> (honeybee) and <i>S. purpatus</i> (sea urchin).  The OrthoMCL DB site is described in Feng et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Database Issue.
