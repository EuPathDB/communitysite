title: PlasmoDB 5.0 is fully released (PlasmoDB 4.4 still available)
category: [EuPathDB,VEuPathDB,PlasmoDB]
---

We are pleased to announce the first full release of the Plasmodium Genome Database, Version 5.0, now as www.plasmodb.org.  (Many of you have had a chance to explore the beta-release version as v5-0.plasmodb.org).  
<p>
PlasmoDB 5.0 implements significant 'under-the-hood' changes, making it much easier to generate future releases in short cycles.  In addition, these changes to ensure a consistent look for all <a href="http://www.apidb.org">ApiDB</a> projects, including PlasmoDB, <a href="http://www.cryptodb.org">CryptoDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.toxodb.org">ToxoDB</a> (supported by a Bioinformatics Resource Center contract from the US NIH / NIAID).
<p>

Because it will take some time to implement all of the PlasmoDB 4.4 functionality in the new architecture, <a href="http://v4-4.plasmodb.org">PlasmoDB 4.4</a> remains active, and the results of queries run under it may be exported to PlasmoDB 5.0 (see <a href="http://v4-4.plasmodb.org/plasmodb/servlet/sv?page=history">PlasmoDB 4.4 Query History</a>).
<p>

New Data in PlasmoDB 5.0 (relative to version 4.4) include:
<ul>
  <li>the complete genome sequence for P. vivax Salvador, along with a complete set of annotated gene models

  <li>the complete genome sequence for P. berghei, along with a complete set of annotated gene models

  <li>the complete genome sequence for P. chabaudi, along with a complete set of annotated gene models

  <li>TIGR Gene Indices for <i>P. vivax</i>, <i>P. falciparum</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i>

  <li>protein-protein interaction data, based on a genome-wide yeast 2-hybrid analysis (LaCount et al. Nature 438:103; 2005)

  <li>new ortholog analyses, using the OrthoMCL algorithm to group genes from several Plasmodium species with other complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (Chen et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 34:D363; 2006)

  <li>Computational predictions for functional interactions in <i>P. falciparum</i> from the PlasmoMAP project are provided based on co-evolution and co-expression of genes (Date & Stoeckert Genome Res. 16:542; 2006). This data is now available as a PlasmoDB query.

  <li>Updated mappings for pathways and Enzyme Classifications (EC).
</ul>
<p>

New Features in PlasmoDB 5.0 Include:
<ul>
 <li>an interactive genome browser, based on the GBrowse module of the GMOD project
 <li>syntenic relationships between <i>P. falciparum</i>, <i>P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i> (Carlton et al., Nature 419:512; 2002).
</ul>
<p>

     Finally, we are pleased to report a new CD-ROM version of the Plasmodium Genome Database.  PlasmoCD provides users lacking reliable high-speed internet connections with full access to the complete genomes of <i>P. falciparum</i>, <i>P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i>, along with gene models, annotation, BLAST hits, ortholog results, expression data, and search functions for querying and integrating these results across species.
