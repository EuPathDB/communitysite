title: PlasmoDB 5.2 is released
category: [EuPathDB,VEuPathDB,PlasmoDB]
---

PlasmoDB 5.2 brings a new emphasis on genetic markers, in the form of four new datasets relating to <i>Plasmodium</i> polymorphisms.  This data is available in the Genome Browser, on the Gene page and in queries.  We continue to move key data from the PlasmoDB 4.4 site to the current site: this release re-introduces gametocyte expression data and expression profile similarity search. The Gene page now includes matches to Interpro protein domains and the Genome Browser offers tracks ESTs from dbEST.
<p>
The PlasmoDB 5.2 site also includes new features such as allowing you to keep your Query History for later use, an improved keyword search and a significantly upgraded Query & Tools page.
<p>

New data and queries in PlasmoDB 5.2:
<ul>
<li> Array data from <i>Kidgell et al. PLoS Pathogens 2006 A systematic map  of genetic variation in Plasmodium falciparum</i>.
<li> Polymorphism data based on resequencing and array analyses.
<ul>
    <li> SNPs generated by the NIH:  Based on CDS sequences from strains 3D7, 7G8, D10, Dd2,  HB3 (kindly provided in advance of publication by X. Su; reference:  J. Mu et al, Nature Genetics, in press)
    <li> SNPs generated by the Broad Institute:  Based on whole genome sequence for strains Dd2 and  HB3, and partial genome sequence for multiple strains (kindly  provided in advance of publication by D. Decaprio, S.K. Volkman &  D.F. Wirth; reference: S.K. Volkman et al, Nature Genetics, in press)
    <li> SNPs generated by the WTSI:  Based on whole genome sequence for strains Ghana1 and IT and a comparison with <i>P. reichenowi</i> (kindly provided in advance of publication by D.C. Jeffares & M.  Berriman; reference: D.C. Jeffares et al, Nature Genetics, in press).
    <li> Array CGH data on a variety of <i>Plasmodium</i> strains kindly provided by E. Winzeler.
</ul>
<li> A query to generate gene lists based on SNP characteristics such as non-synonymous / synonymous substitutions and SNP density.
<li> <i>Plasmodium</i> ESTs from the Oct. 2, 2006 release of dbEST.
<li> Interproscan analysis of <i>Plasmodium</i> proteins.
<li> PlasmoCyc pathways, available from gene pages
</ul>

New features in PlasmoDB 5.2:
<ul>
<li> Save past searches (Persistent Query History)
<li> Reorganized Query and Tools page
<li> Improved text search
<li> New tutorial movies
</ul>

Features and data moved from PlasmoDB 4.4 to 5.2:
<ul>
<li> Gametocyte data from <i>Young et al. Mol Biochem parasitol 2005.</i>
<li> Expression profile similarity for erythrocytic stage data from <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7, HB3, and DD2 (<i>Llinas et al., Nucl. Acids. Res. 2006</i>;  <i>Bozdech et al PLos Biol 2003</i>). New to 5.2 is the inclusion of <i>P. berghei</i> data (<i>Hall et al. Science 2005</i>).          
</ul>
