The ApiDB team is pleased to announce the release of PlasmoDB_5.4.

<br><br><u>New data include:</u>
<ul>
<li> A slightly modified reference genome for <i>P. falciparum</i> (several gaps have been closed on chr10 & 11).</li>
<li> P. berghei gametocyte proteomics data (Khan et al, Cell 121:675-87).</li>
<li> Many additional <i>P. falciparum</i> SNPs (unpublished data from the Broad Inst).</li>
<li> Additional ESTs (Watanabe et al, Nucl Acids Res 32:D334-8; Lu et al, BMC Genomics 8:255; Florent et al, Mol.Biochem.Parasitol. 135:143-8)</li>
<li> Expression profiling data for antigenic and adherent variants of <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 (Mok et al, Molec Biochem Parasitol 151:184-92).</li>
<li> User comments submitted prior to June 2007 have now been incorporated into the official annotation.</li>
<li> Sequence assemblies for 11 <i>falciparum</i> strains from the Broad Institute have just been released and are available on the PlasmoDB download site.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<u>New features include:</u>
<ul>
<li> Faster loading of Gene and Genome Browser pages. </li>
<li> Improved synteny views in the Genome Browser.</li>
<li> Browser views of rodent malaria genomes colored to indicate chromosomes (Kooij et al, PLoS Pathog 1:e44). </li>
<li> Gene page links to various external data sources (including PlasmoMAP,  TDRtargets, UCSC <i>P. falciparum</i> genome browser, Ontology-based Pattern Identification and literature databases).</li>
<li> More convenient access to help ... please click the "Ask us a Question" link on the left of every page, or the "Contact Us" at bottom to report problems or suggest improvements to the database.</li>
</ul>

Note that a mechanism has now been established to ensure that User Comments on genes or sequences are incorporated into the official annotation in a timely manner.  In response to a banner posted on PlasmoDB and e-mail to malaria researchers, several hundred new User Comments were entered by the community in advance of a <i>P. falciparum</i> genome reannotation workshop jointly sponsored by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst and the PlasmoDB team during the week of Oct 21!
<br><br>
There is still time to enter additional User Comments while the updated annotation is being reviewed in preparation for deposition in GenBank and release on PlasmoDB and GeneDB in early 2008.  Please use the User Comments feature as a repository for valuable information on:
<ul>
<li> Naming, e.g. "Apical membrane antigen 1 is also known as AMA1, AMA-1, Pf83, Rhoptry Membrane Antigen, RMA1" or "this gene is now recognizable as XXX based on Pfam domain ###."</li>
<li> Gene models, e.g. "Corrected cDNA sequence for gene XXX: &lt;sequence&gt;, based on RACE and primer extension for 5' UTR and polyA-tailed cDNA clone for 3' UTR" or "RT-PCR confirms annotated CDS sequence as correct."  Note that confirmation of existing annotation can be as valuable as corrections!</li>
<li> Function, e.g. "Enzymatic activity for gene XXX has been confirmed" or "Protein XXX is predicted to target to the apicoplast, but an epitope-tagged construct shows cytoplasmic localization."  Be sure to provide name and/or PubMedID if available.</li>
</ul>

For data that is not readily accommodated in this form, or datasets too extensive to enter as individual User Comments (expression profiling studies, systematic evaluation of gene models by RT-PCR, etc), please contact support@PlasmoDB.org.
