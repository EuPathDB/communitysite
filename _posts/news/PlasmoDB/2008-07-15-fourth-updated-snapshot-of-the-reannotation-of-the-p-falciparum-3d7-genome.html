PlasmoDB has released the fourth snapshot of the reannotation of the<i> P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome. The reannotation presented in PlasmoDB is a work in progress and intended to inform you about the new annotation and elicit any feedback that you may have.  Please add user comments to any genes for which you have evidence that supports or refutes the new annotation.  In the previous snapshot, many product names for re-annotated genes were accidentally reverted back to the original name. This new snapshot has the correct re-annotated product names.
