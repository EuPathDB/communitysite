A listing of microarrays that are available to Plasmodium researchers has been posted at 
<a href="http://plasmodb.org/common/microarrays/">http://plasmodb.org/common/microarrays/</a>. 
This list is meant to provide in a single location a summary of the publicly  
available microarrays targeting Plasmodium genomes (including <i>P. falciparum</i>, 
<i>P. berghei</i>, <i>P. yoelii</i>, and <i>P. vivax</i>). Also provided are 
details, including, for some of the arrays, an updated mapping to genes in PlasmoDB.
