We are pleased to announce the release of the fifth snapshot of the reannotation of the <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome.
<p>
The effort to systematically update the annotation for <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome started in October 2007 with a weeklong workshop co-organized by staff from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and the EuPathDB team. The Wellcome Trust and Burroughs Wellcome Fund-sponsored workshop was held in Hinxton, UK and was attended by nearly 30 Plasmodium researchers contributing expertise in various aspects of Plasmodium biology, plus more than 10 bioinformatics support staff from the Artemis, GeneDB and EuPathDB teams.  Ongoing annotation and error checking is being carried out by the GeneDB group from WTSI.
