We are pleased to announce that the beta SchistoDB is now available at <a href="http://beta.schistodb.net/">beta.schistodb.net</a>.  SchistoDB is supported by ApiDB/EuPathDB (<a href="http://eupathdb.org">www.eupathdb.org</a>).
<br><br>
  Please send a message to the support team from the link at the bottom of the SchistoDB web page (<a href="http://beta.schistodb.net/schistodb/help.jsp"  target="_blank">Contact Us!</a>).
<br><br>
SchistoDB, like the other ApiDB/EuPathDB sites, offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify these three schistosoma species' genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  In addition, SchistoDB contains pre-computed phylogenetic trees for proteins with homologues in other eukaryotic genomes.
