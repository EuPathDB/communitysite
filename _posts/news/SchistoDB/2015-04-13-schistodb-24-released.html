We are pleased to announce the release of SchistoDB in collaboration with the EuPathDB resources.  This first release includes the genome sequence and annotation 
of <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> Egypt and the assembled genome sequence of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i> Anhui and <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> Puerto Rico.  
Additional information about these genomes is available in the <a href="/a/getDataset.do?display=detail#Genomes%20and%20Annotation">dataset section</a> of SchistoDB.  
We look forward to working with you as we integrate additional genomes and functional data over the coming years.
