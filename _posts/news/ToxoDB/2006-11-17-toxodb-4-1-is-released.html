title: ToxoDB 4.1 is released
category: [ToxoDB]
---

ToxoDB 4.1 delivers the apicoplast genome and has incorporated  the genomic sequence of <i>T. gondii</i> 
VEG and RH (Chr Ia and Chr Ib) strains. The Genome Browser offers tracks for the ESTs from dbEST, ORFs 
and the Affymetrix Probe Data (provided by Amit Bahl, Roos Lab, University of Pennsylvania). We also provide 
Nucmer alignment of GT1, VEG and RH strains against the reference ME49 strain and SNPs generated from this 
alignment. The Gene page now includes matches to Interpro protein domains and ESTs. 
<p>The ToxoDB 4.1 site also includes new features such as allowing you to keep your 
<a href='http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQueryHistory.do'>Query History</a> for later use, an improved keyword search and a significantly 
upgraded <a href='http://toxodb.org/toxo/queries_tools.jsp'>Query & Tools</a> page.
<p>
New data and queries in ToxoDB 4.1:
<ul>
<li> Apicoplast genome and annotation
<li> Affymetrix probes mapped to genome, available in GBrowse
<li> Nucmer Alignments SNPs of VEG and RH (Chr Ia and Chr Ib) strains
<li> Toxoplasma ESTs mapped to genome, from the Oct. 2, 2006 release of dbEST
<li> Interproscan analysis of Toxoplasma proteins
<li> ORFs greater than 50aa
</ul>
New features in ToxoDB 4.1:
<ul>
<li> A recently designed User Login process. This will allow for:
  <ul>
  <li> making use of the new Persistent Query History functionality, i.e. retrieve your past searches for 
       current use, as well as save further searches for the future.
  <li> using the "Add a Comment" facility, for commenting on genes and chromosomes/scaffolds.
  <li> adding yourself to mailing list of ToxoDB, and other ApiDB member sites.
  </ul>
<li> There are now queries available on SNP, EST and ORF datatypes, along with those on genes and sequences.
<li> Query History page provides additional functionality. For example, user can now rename performed 
     queries; or delete all queries with press of a button, in addition to doing boolean operations on 
     query results as well as viewing or downloading these.
<li> Reorganized Query and Tools page
<li> Improved text search
<!--li> New tutorial movies -->
</ul>
