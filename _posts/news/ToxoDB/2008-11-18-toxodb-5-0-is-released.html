We are pleased to announce the release of ToxoDB 5.0.  This is a major release of ToxoDB that includes several new large-scale datasets many of which have been graciously provided pre-publication to ToxoDB (Please see the data source section of ToxoDB for details and provider information).  In addition, several new features and improvements have been implemented.
<p>

<u>New datasets include:</u>
<ul>
<li>Fully sequenced and annotated genomes of three strains of <i>T. gondii</i> - GT1 (Type I), ME49 (Type II) and VEG (Type III).</li>
<li>Genome sequence and annotation of the closely related <i>Neospora caninum</i> (annotation not fully complete yet).</li>
<li>Whole genome ChIP on chip analysis of three <i>T. gondii</i> strains.</li>
<li>Several proteomics datasets.</li>
<li>Microarray Expression profiling of the 3 archetypal <i>T. gondii</i> lineages.</li>
</ul>

<u>New features include:</u>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned result summary pages that accommodate the annotations from multiple strains of <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>N. caninum</i>.  This should allow you to quickly access all or strain specific query results.</li>
<li>Synteny mapping is provided on gene pages and in the associated genome browser (gbrowse).</li>
<li>Improved annotations of Rhoptry proteins (ROPs) and SAG-related sequences (SRSs). </li>
</ul>
