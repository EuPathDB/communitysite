<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to 
announce new features in ToxoDB 6.0<br> 
<br> 
Community Annotation<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span><br> 
<br> 
</span>As many of you know, a community driven annotation effort 
has been underway. &nbsp;The response has been great (350 genes 
have been annotated by the community so far) and we are happy to now 
include these annotations in ToxoDB. &nbsp;The ultimate goal is to 
translate this effort into changes in product names and gene models. 
&nbsp;As a first step, since this process is still ongoing, 
community annotations can be viewed by searching using the 
<a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByTextSearch">
text search tool</a> in ToxoDB and limiting your search to 
the Community annotation. &nbsp;To view all genes that have a 
community annotation associated with them simply enter the wild card 
"*" in the text search field. &nbsp;The annotation itself is 
prominently displayed on the gene pages right under the product name. 
&nbsp;<br> 
<br> 
As noted, this is an ongoing process. &nbsp;We have several more 
annotations to incorporate and many more promised. &nbsp;<span

</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Features:</span><br><br> 
<ul> 
 <li>The gray tool bar at the top of all ToxoDB web pages has 
been enhanced to include a link to the "My Basket" feature including an 
indication of how may items are in the basket.</li> 
 <li>The genome browser has been updated to version 1.7, which 
offers enhanced features and stability.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Weighted searches are now available. &nbsp;This feature 
allows you to assign an arbitrary weight to the searches (steps) in 
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list 
of your results.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul>
