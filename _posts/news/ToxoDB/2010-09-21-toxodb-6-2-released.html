<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of ToxoDB 6.2<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Data in this release:</span><span
style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
<br>
</span>This release of ToxoDB includes the tachyzoite cell-cycle
microarray
data from Michael White (<a
href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012354"><span
style="font-style: italic;">Behnke et. al.</span></a>).&nbsp; Searches
against this data are available in the <a
href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence">microarray
search page</a> of ToxoDB under the heading "Tachyzoite Cell Cycle
(White)".&nbsp; This data can be interrogated using a number of
searches:<br>
<ul>
<li>Genes can be identified based on the fold change in their
expression between selected time points from the experiment using the
T.g.
Cell Cycle (fold change).</li>
<li>Genes can be identified based on their maximal or minimal
expression among selected time points using the T.g. Cell Cycle (exprn
timing) search.</li>
<li>Genes with a similar expression profile throughout the cell cycle
compared to an input gene can be identified using the T.g. Cell Cycle
(similarity) search.&nbsp; For example, genes that have a similar
expression profile throughout the cell cycle compared to a putative
nucleoporin can be identified as illustrated by this <a
href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/im.do?s=590909d092fa1fdf">search strategy</a>.&nbsp;
A graphical representation of the search results is presented along
with the list of results showing the expression profile of the
reference gene and each of the comparator genes.</li>
</ul>
In addition to specific searches against the cell cycle data, each gene
page contains a graphical representation of the gene's expression
profile throughout the cell cycle.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New features in this release:</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Improved organization of the <a
href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence">microarray
search page</a>.</li>
<li>The search strategy window is now resizable.</li>
</ul>
