<b>We are pleased to report that the following Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) have been awarded in connection with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC):</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>The Toxoplasma oocyst transcriptome and proteome</b><br>
   John Boothroyd, Matt Bogyo (Stanford) & Pat Conrad (UC Davis)<br>
   This project is expected to yield expression data from an important, but inaccessible, life cycle stage (1 yr). <br><br></li>
<li><b>A comprehensive catalog of the T. gondii & N. caninum parasite & infected host cell transcriptome & proteome</b><br>
   Brian Gregory (Univ. Pennsylvania) & Jonathan Wastling (Univ. Liverpool)<br>
   This project will produce an immense volume of sequence data, driving database improvements for handling 'next-gen' sequencing, non-coding RNAs, and interrogating host & pathogen datasets in parallel (2 yr).<br><br></li>

<li><b>Dissection of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses by mass spectrometry-based metabolite QTL</b><br>
   Manuel Llin&aacute;s (Princeton) & Michael Ferdig (Notre Dame)<br>
   This project is expected to improve handling of genetic mapping data, incorporation of metabolomics results (integrated with pathway maps), and linking of specific genetic loci with metabolite abundance (2 yr).<br><br></li>
</ul>

A biennial competition for DBP awards is mandated by the BRC contract from NIH/NIAID, and supported by a total of $1.2M in total costs per award cycle.  The goal of this program is to produce high value genomic-scale datasets for the EuPathDB user community, and drive the further development of bioinformatics resources for data analysis and mining.<br><br>

Letters of intent (LOI) were solicited in February (see Feb 4 News item), and reviewed by the EuPathDB Scientific Working Group (SWG; see News, March 31).  12 full applications were solicited from among the ~50 LOIs received, and awards were based on further scientific review by the SWG, and in consultation with NIAID program staff.  Cost negotiations and 'in kind' contributions from other sources made it possible to support 3 applications, from 6 investigators (in some cases, more than one LOI was merged into a single award).<br><br>

We received far more high quality proposals than could be supported, testifying to the need for such mechanisms for data production bioinformatics analysis.  The EuPathDB team looks forward to working with members of our user community who are seeking funding for such projects from external sources.  Inquiries, including requests for support letters, should be directed to the EuPathDB staff (click on the 'Contact Us' link).<br><br>

<b>A new solicitation for DBPs is anticipated in 2011, and will be announced on the EuPathDB web site.</b>
