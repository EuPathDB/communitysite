       <h4>Publication from the <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> GSCID Genome Project</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A publication comparing the genomes of 62 globally distributed <i>T. gondii</i> isolates 
            recently appeared in Nature Communications (PMID: 
            <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26738725"> 26728725</a>). These data are integrated into
            ToxoDB as sequence read coverage plots in GBrowse and searches that distinguish isolates based on single 
            nucleotide polymorphisms are available. Dataset title:

       <h4>New Tutorials</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/z6c_FhMCdPo">Exploring expression distributions with our Percentile Ranking searches</a> - 
            Percentile ranking is one way that EuPathDB analyzes expression data.  This tutorial 
            describes our percentile ranking of expression data and the searches that we offer based on that analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Yk9kkaPAmAE">Finding Differentially expressed genes based on Fold Change with a P-value</a> - 
            One way EuPathDB analyzes expression is to determine statistically significant differential gene expression using the  
            Fisher's exact test. This tutorial describes our Fold Change w/ P-value searches that return differentially 
            expressed genes based on the level of statistical confidence that you choose.

        <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
        Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
        When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
        When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
