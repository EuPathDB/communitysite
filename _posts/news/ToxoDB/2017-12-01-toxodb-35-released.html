      <h3><b>New Data in Release 35</b></h3>
        
        <h4>RNA Sequence</h4>
          <ul>
             <li>
               <a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/app/record/dataset/DS_66c644dff7"><i>T gondii</i> Transcriptome during infection in 4 mouse cell types</a> &mdash; 
               mRNA Illumina sequences from 4 different mouse cell types infected with <i>T. gondii</i> and aligned to the ME49 Genome as mixed parasite/host samples.
               <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28775382">Swierzy et al.</a>  This data set has a matching host data in HostDB &mdash;
               <a href="http://hostdb.org/hostdb/app/record/dataset/DS_92a3bc8cb7">Transcriptomes of 4 <i>M. musculus</i> cell types during infection with <i>T. gondii</i></a>. 
               <br>
            </li>
          </ul>   
      
        <h4>Proteomics</h4>

      <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
      
       <h4>Dedicated search for Genes with protein products that have post-translational modifications</h4>
       <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
       
          ToxoDB offers a new search, 
          <a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByPTM">Identify Genes based on Post-Translational Modifications</a>, 
          which returns genes whose protein products were experimentally determined to be post-translationally modified. This search is categorized under Search for Genes, Proteomics, Post-Translational Modification.
       </div>
      
      <h4>GO Slim Implementation<h4>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
          
          GO Slim terms are now indicated in EuPathDB sites in the following ways:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The search,
                <a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByGoTerm">Identify Genes based on GO Terms</a>, 
                now includes an GO Subset option for limiting the search to only GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>GO Terms tables on gene pages now contain a 'GO Subset' column which identifies GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>The GO enrichment analysis has an option for limiting the analysis to GO Slim terms. This will limit both 
                the background and the gene list of interest in the Fisher's exact test that determines enrichment. 
                </li>
          </ul>
       </div>
       
       <h4>Revigo and Word Cloud access from GO Enrichment results</h4>
       <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
       
          ToxoDB offers a link between our GO Enrichment results and a Word Cloud visualization as well as 
          Revigo, a tool that provides GO term summarization and visualization. The links to Revigo and the 
          Word Cloud now appear as buttons that are right justified above the GO enrichment result table.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
