               Toxoplasma mitochondrial matrix proteome determined using two independent, biotin-labelling approaches: ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) approach and the BirA*/BioID approach. 
               This data was provided pre-publication by Giel van Dooren, Australian National University.

      <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
      
         <h4>Beta EuPathDB Workspace</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Announcing the Beta release of EuPathDB Workspace, a private workspace that can interface 
         with EuPathDB Galaxy and allows for viewing and interrogating private data against data that is already 
         integrated into EuPathDB (public data). The first EuPathDB workspace tool, 'Bigwig files to EuPathDB' 
         exports bigwig files from EuPathDB Galaxy to EuPathDB. 
         The tool creates a EuPathDB Data Set which is managed from the My Data Sets page along with your other private data sets. 
         Each data set also receives a record page which lists all files that the data set contains, offers file management 
         functions and ports files to the genome browser for viewing.<br><br>

         </ul>
         
         <h4>Pathway Improvements</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>
               Semantic zooming of Pathway drawings on Pathway record pages - At low zoom levels, pathway nodes appear as 
               glyphs.  At mid zoom levels, the main compound nodes appear as molecular formulas.  At high zoom levels, enzymes and 
               side nodes appear as formulas, terms or Enzyme commission numbers. Clicking on a node will retrieve details about the 
               node, regardless of zoom level.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
