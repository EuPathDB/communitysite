  <h3>New data in {{project}} 49</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>EBI Pipeline</h4>
    {{project}} 49 represents the first release that employs the EBI pipeline for analyzing genomes and RNA-Seq data. (<a href="/a/app/static-content/methods.html">{{project}} Analysis Methods</a>) All genomes were run through the EBI pipeline, updating all analyses such as InterproScan and repeat identification.  While much of the EBI pipeline is the same as our previous in-house pipeline, these differences are noted:
    <ul>
      <li>Expression values calculated from RNA-Seq data are now presented as TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) instead of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) or RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million). <a href="https://rna-seqblog.com/rpkm-fpkm-and-tpm-clearly-explained/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></li>
      <li>Signal peptide predictions are now made with <a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/" target="_blank">SignalP-5.0</a>, updated from <a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-3.0/" target="_blank">SignalP-3.0</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Annotated genome</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_60798ff9a5"><i>Besnoitia besnoiti</i> strain Bb-Ger1</a> &ndash; PacBio sequence assembled with HGAP v3. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146849" target="_blank">Schares et al. 2017</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Unannotated genome sequence</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_18b198ca24"><i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> strain RH 2016</a> &ndash; Full genome sequence for <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> strain RH 2016 - sequenced with Illumina methods and assembled with SOAPdenovo v. May-2013.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27355363" target="_blank">Lau et al. 2016</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Transcriptomics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>RFLP Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_b23482fada"> A canine isolate of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i></a> &ndash; RFLP genotype of an isolate of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> obtained from a dog with neurological disease in the city of Salvador, Brazil.

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 49</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li>When revisiting a search page, your previous parameter values are automatically loaded.  This is especially useful for the BLAST search which now retains the input sequence.  </li>
    <li>The cytoscape drawing on metabolic pathway record pages now contains:
      <ul>
      <li>a new search function for finding nodes within the drawing.  After running a search, the drawing centers on the nodes which match the search term and highlights them with a bold green border.</li>
      <li>a "Reset Layout" button that will clear all node paintings as well as reset the node positions and zoom levels.</li>
      <li>a checkbox for toggling your mouse function between zooming the drawing or scrolling the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data set and Organism record pages now contain direct links to our Downloads section where the option is available to download genome-scale sequence and annotation files.  </li>
    <li>The <a href="/a/app/search/rflp-isolate/BySampleDetails">Identify RFLP Genotype Isolates based on RFLP Genotype</a>' search now employs our 'filter parameter' for configuring the RFLP genotype of isolates returned by the search.  Running the search with default parameters returns all RFLP genotyped isolates.  Use the filter parameter to define the profile of genetic markers for isolates returned by the search.  </li>
   </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
