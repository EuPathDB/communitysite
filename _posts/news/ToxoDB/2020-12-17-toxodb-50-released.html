  <h3>New data in {{project}} 50</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    
    <h4>Annotated genome</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_413cde922d"><i>oxoplasma gondii </i> strain RH-88</a> &ndash; Genome Sequence and Annotation for Toxoplasma gondii RH-88. Genomic material was obtained from the human isolate RH-88 collected in 2016. Sequencing was conducted using PacBio and data was assembled (HGAP v.3 and mapping to ME49 reference genome) into 13 nuclear chromosomes and 1 apicoplast genome. Consensus sequence was polished with pilon v1.22 after mapping RH-88 Illumina sequencing reads onto assembled contigs with bowtie2.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Proteomics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_81ccbd2a97">Self-assembled vesicles (RH) quantitative proteomics</a> &ndash; Quantitative proteomes of self-assembled vesicles from Toxoplasma gondii RH. Samples include ectosomes, exosomes, and ecto/exo supernatant.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434009" target="_blank"> Ramírez-Flores et al. 2019 <a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Transcription Start Sites</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_011c12b8d3">Genome-wide mapping of transcription initiation</a> &ndash; Strand-specific 5′-end RNA sequencing reads were collapsed onto the 5′-most nucleotide (5′ tag) to generate maps of transcription initiation events.

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 50</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li>When revisiting a search page, your previous parameter values are automatically loaded.  This is especially useful for the BLAST search which now retains the input sequence.  </li>
    <li>The cytoscape drawing on metabolic pathway record pages now contains:
      <ul>
      <li>a new search function for finding nodes within the drawing.  After running a search, the drawing centers on the nodes which match the search term and highlights them with a bold green border.</li>
      <li>a "Reset Layout" button that will clear all node paintings as well as reset the node positions and zoom levels.</li>
      <li>a checkbox for toggling your mouse function between zooming the drawing or scrolling the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data set and Organism record pages now contain direct links to our Downloads section where the option is available to download genome-scale sequence and annotation files.  </li>
    <li>The <a href="/a/app/search/rflp-isolate/BySampleDetails">Identify RFLP Genotype Isolates based on RFLP Genotype</a>' search now employs our 'filter parameter' for configuring the RFLP genotype of isolates returned by the search.  Running the search with default parameters returns all RFLP genotyped isolates.  Use the filter parameter to define the profile of genetic markers for isolates returned by the search.  </li>
   </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
