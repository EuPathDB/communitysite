  <h3>New data in {{project}} 51</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    
    <h4>Transcriptomics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/TODO"><i>Toxoplasma gondii </i> Parasite transcriptome during infection in mouse brain.  </a> &ndash; Transcriptome of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> from injected mouse neurons. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878927" target="_blank">Merritt et al. 2020</a>. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Proteomics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/TODO">Secretome of T gondii tachyzoites (RH) isolated from infected mice and the proteome of extracellular vesicles (exosomes and ectosomes)</a> &ndash; Proteomic analysis of the secretome of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> tachyzoites (RH) and the proteomic profile of the vesicles released. For the secretome, parasites were isolated from infected mice, purified, and secretions were collected. The complete secretion was analyzed by MS generating the secretome. In addition, a proteomic characterization was achieved in exosomes, ectosomes and the supernatant obtained by differential centrifugation of the secretory products.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434009" target="_blank"> Ramírez-Flores et al. 2019 </a>.

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 51</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li><a href="/a/app/workspace/blast/new" target="_blank">BLAST<i><sup>beta</sup></i> tool</a> &ndash; a new BLAST tool with multi-BLAST capabilities.  Input a single sequence or several fasta-formatted sequences at once.  Our tool uses NCBI BLAST to find genes, genomic sequences, ESTs, or PopSet Sequences that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence.  </li>
    <li><a href="https://statis-content.veupathdb.org//documents/VEuPathDB_BRC4_usage_metrics_report.pdf">Usage</a> and <a href="https://statis-content.veupathdb.org//documents/VEuPathDB_BRC4_performance_metrics_report.pdf">performance</a> metrics for VEuPathDB sites are now updated monthly.  </li>
    <li>Community annotations made in {{project}} via Apollo are now represented on gene pages in the Gene Models graphic. In addition, links from the gene page to Apollo are offered to facilitate community annotations. <a href="{{'/assets/images/51-apollo-news.png' | absolute_url}}">Example image.</a>  Please see our <a href="https://youtu.be/RMXZDBMh8Fo">Apollo webinar</a> for instruction. </li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
