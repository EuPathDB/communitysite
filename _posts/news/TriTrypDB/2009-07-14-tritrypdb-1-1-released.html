<li>A microarray experiment examining the axenic promastigote-to-amastigote differentiation of <i>L. donovani</i> was provided by researchers at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute and Technion Institute and is available for query and display on record pages.
<li>A new search strategy interface that enables users to more easily construct complex searches is released for the first time in TriTrypDB 1.1.
