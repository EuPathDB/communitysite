<b>We are pleased to announce the release of TriTrypDB 1.3</b><br>
<p>
This release of TriTrypDB includes a new ChIP-chip experiment identifying regions of active transcription in <i>L. major</i> from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=19356248">Thomas et. al. "Histone acetylations mark origins of polycistronic transcription in Leishmania major"</a>.  The data are available as Genome Browser tracks.  For an example click <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yfwba25">here</a>.
<p>
We anticipate a more significant release for TriTrypDB in late December which will include updated annotations for all the TriTryp genomes as well as three additional kinetoplastid genomes from GeneDB.
