<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of TriTrypDB 2.2<br>
<br>
<br>
This release of TriTrypDB contains the following new datasets and
features:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
New Data:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Microarray analysis of
three <span style="font-style: italic;">L.
major </span>developmental stages graciously provided
pre-publication by Stephen Beverley's group. Searching this data can be
performed via the <a
 href="http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence">microarray
expression search page</a> in TriTrypDB.</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Features introduced this year:<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for putative secreted proteinases upregulated in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T. cruzi </span>epimastigotes.
&nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>

  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> (new in this release) allows you to bookmark
and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">User comments matter:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">There
are over 400 gene-page comments from TriTrypDB users, all of which have
been reviewed by annotators at GeneDB, the Seattle Biomedical Research
Institute and EuPathDB. &nbsp; Updated genes can be accessed via
prominent linkouts to GeneDB from TriTrypDB
gene pages. Comments from you are instrumental to guiding our
annotators. &nbsp;To learn how you can add a user comment please

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>
