    <p>We are pleased to announce the 9th annual EuPathDB workshop to be held in
      Athens, Georgia, USA from June 15 to Wednesday, June 18, 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <br>
      Please note that the workshop expenses, in addition to room and board
      costs are covered by EuPathDB (see cost and fees section below).&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Come learn how to effectively use EuPathDB resources and mine available
      data to help guide your research.<br>
      <br>
      For more information and to apply, please visit:
      http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/<br>
      <br>
      The workshop will cover all of our component databases (EuPathDB,
      AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB, PiroplasmaDB,
      ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL), and will run from 6:00PM (18:00)
      on Sunday, June 15 to 5:00PM (17:00) on Wednesday, June 18, 2014.<br>
      <br>
      The application deadline is February 28, 2014 and the course is limited to
      30 participants.<br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Who should apply:</strong></em>&nbsp; This workshop is
      intended to be a 3 day thorough and intensive introduction to database
      resources that are part of the EuPathDB.org Bioinformatics Resource Center
      (EuPathDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB,
      PiroplasmaDB, ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL). The ideal
      candidate would have a need to become an expert user of one or more of
      these database resources and presumably has a bioinformatics research
      problem that they might work on as part of their training while attending
      the course. Preference will be given to applicants that are in a position
      to benefit most from intensive training and that are in a position to
      return to their home institution and transfer their newly acquired
      knowledge to others. Evaluation of the applications will focus heavily on
      your responses to the questions asked on the application page and on
      letters of recommendation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <strong><em>Costs and Fees:</em> </strong>The course is free. Housing
      (double occupancy), all training materials and lunches are covered.
      Attendees are expected to provide their own transportation to the course
      and pay for a few of their meals. Letters of acceptance will be mailed
      early to facilitate the solicitation of outside travel funds.<br>
      <br>
      Hotel room charges for a shared room will be paid by EuPathDB for the
      nights of June 15 through June 18. Attendees who would like to have a
      private room will need to pay the difference of $47 per night plus
      tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
