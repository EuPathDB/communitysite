           <li>
            <a href="http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app/record/dataset/DS_1cc46f3acb">Circadian control of bloodstream and procyclic form transcriptome (AnTat1.1)</a> &mdash;

      <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
      
       <h4>Dedicated search for Genes with protein products that have post-translational modifications</h4>
       <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
       
          TriTrypDB offers a new search, 
          <a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByPTM">Identify Genes based on Post-Translational Modifications</a>, 
          which returns genes whose protein products were experimentally determined to be post-translationally modified. This search is categorized under Search for Genes, Proteomics, Post-Translational Modification.
       </div>
      
      <h4>GO Slim Implementation<h4>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
          
          GO Slim terms are now indicated in EuPathDB sites in the following ways:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The search,
                <a href="http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByGoTerm">Identify Genes based on GO Terms</a>, 
                now includes an GO Subset option for limiting the search to only GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>GO Terms tables on gene pages now contain a 'GO Subset' column which identifies GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>The GO enrichment analysis has an option for limiting the analysis to GO Slim terms. This will limit both 
                the background and the gene list of interest in the Fisher's exact test that determines enrichment. 
                </li>
          </ul>
       </div>
       
       <h4>Revigo and Word Cloud access from GO Enrichment results</h4>
       <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
       
          TriTrypDB offers a link between our GO Enrichment results and a Word Cloud visualization as well as 
          Revigo, a tool that provides GO term summarization and visualization. The links to Revigo and the 
          Word Cloud now appear as buttons that are right justified above the GO enrichment result table.

      <h3><b>News on annotation</b></h3>
      
       <h4>Personnel and gene page comments</h4>
       <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
       
          We are pleased to inform that David Starns recently joined the EuPathDB team as an annotator/curator 
          to replace Fatima Silva on her departure from the project. Achchuthan Shanmugasundram (achchu@liverpool.ac.uk) 
          and David Starns (D.E.Starns@liverpool.ac.uk) are curating TriTrypDB genomes 
          and can be contacted regarding functional annotation.
          <br><br>
          Gene page comments that are entered 
          by users are actively curated at GeneDB. Since the Kinetoplastid Molecular Cell Biology Meeting 2017, 
          we devoted substantial effort to curating gene page comments submitted for <i>Trypanosoma 
          brucei</i> 927 genome and updating functional annotations (see table below). These annotations are 
          currently available in 
          <a href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Tbruceibrucei927">GeneDB</a> 
          and will be integrated as functional annotations in TriTrypDB 36.<br><br>

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
