title: New Features in TrichDB
category: [TrichDB]
---

<b>We are pleased to
announce the implementation of new features in TrichDB:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Genes based on Orthology Phylogenetic
Profile:&nbsp; For example you may ask for genes in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T. vaginalis&nbsp;</span>that
do not have orthologs in mammals.&nbsp; Click here to explore this
feature.</li>
  <li>A table of paralogs (if any) is now available on gene pages
allowing you to view expanded gene families -- See <a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/app/record/gene/TVAG_386080">TVAG_386080</a>
for example (scroll down to the Orthologs and Paralogs Table).</li>
  <li>Now after you perform a BlastN against genomic sequence you
can link from the blast output to the correct coordinates in the
genome browser.&nbsp; This allows you to explore annotation and
other functional data in relation to your BLAST hits.</li>
  <li>The type ahead feature has been implemented for GO term, EC
number and Interpro domain searches.</li>
  <li>You can now edit or delete your user comments.</li>
  <li>You can now modify your user profile, change your password
or your email address.</li>
</ul>
<br>
We are still collecting data sets for an upcoming release of
TrichDB.&nbsp; This release will include a large expansion in data
content and we look forward to receiving more data sets from you.<br>
<br>
Also, check out the new version of <a href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
EuPathDB permits searches across all organism-specific sites and now
includes the strategy system.&nbsp;Build multi-step searches using
a graphical interface that is feature-rich. You can save your
strategies, modify any step in a strategy or even share your strategy
with other scientists.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
The EuPathDB team.
