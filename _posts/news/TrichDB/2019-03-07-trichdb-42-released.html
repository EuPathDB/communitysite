         <ul>
           <li>
             Updated Alignment Tool on Gene Pages &ndash; <br>
             The Clustal Omega alignment tool in the 'Orthologs and Paralogs within EuPathDB' table now 
             accommodates protein, CDS and genomic sequence alignments. To run Clustal Omega, select genes from the table. Then choose the sequence 
             type and initiate the alignment with the 'Run Clutal Omega for selected genes' button. Output formats include Mismatches highlighted, FASTA, PHYLIP, STOCKHOLM, 
             and VIENNA. This tool replaces the 'Retrieve multiple 
             sequence alignment or multi-FASTA' tool.
           </li>
           <li>
             Beta access to JBrowse &ndash; <br>
             A beta implementation of the 
             <a href="https://jbrowse.org/" target="_blank">JBrowse Genome Browser</a>, is available from gene pages. Use the 
             JBrowse Genome Browser link under the graphic Shortcuts on the gene page.

           </li>
           <li>
             New Gene Page STRING tool &ndash; <br>
             The 'Protein features and properties' section now includes an option to submit the protein sequence 
             to the <a href="https://string-db.org/" target="_blank">STRING</a> functional protein association network.

           </li>
           <li>
             Result Table Improvements &ndash; <br>
             Result column configurations and sorting are now saved for each strategy step and will be retained 
             when you come back or when you share a strategy with someone else.
           </li>
           <li>
             New Options for FASTA downloads &ndash; <br>
             The header line of FASTA formatted downloads can be configured to contain only the gene ID.  The sequence can 
             be configured to appear on a signle line or the standard 60 characters per line.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
