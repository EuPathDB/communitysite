             All EuPathDB sites now offer the <a href="https://jbrowse.org/" target="_blank">JBrowse Genome Browser</a>.  GBrowse will be phased out in coming releases.  Please 
             <a href="https://eupathdb.org/eupathdb/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a> with comments and suggestions for the genome browser.

             The new RNASeq Transcript Summary tool on gene pages helps reveal experiments in which the gene is highly 
             regulated. The tool displays the gene's FPKM values for all experiments in TrichDB and offers features such as 
             log/linear scaling, zoom and pan to explore the gene's expression in each experiment.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
