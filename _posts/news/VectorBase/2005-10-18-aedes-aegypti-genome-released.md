The Microbial Sequencing Centers of the Broad Institute and The Institute for Genomic Research are pleased to announce the public release of a new assembly for the genome sequence of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.  As the result of increased sequence coverage the overall quality of the sequence, both in terms of coverage and continuity, has been vastly improved.  The total size of the contigs in this assembly is 1.3 Gb, and the average coverage within the assembly is now 7.6 fold.<br/><br/>For more information, look at the <a href="/organisms/aedes-aegypti"><i>Aedes aegypti</i> genome page.</a>
