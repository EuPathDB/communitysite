VectorBase encourages community scientists to contribute to the Ixodes annotation effort through submission of their own gene models. Community-generated gene models will be displayed as a separate manual annotation track in the Ixodes Genome Browser. Community annotations will also be considered for incorporation into the final Ixodes gene set, which is targeted for release at Vectorbase and GenBank in a few months.  
Community scientists wishing to submit manual annotations may do so through the VectorBase Community Annotation Pipeline. An account is required to submit gene models. To sign-up for an account, click the User tab in the top-right corner of the <a href="http://www.vectorbase.org/index.php">VectorBase homepage</a>. To submit a gene model, follow VectorBase instructions.  For further information regarding submission of community annotations, please contact the Ixodes VectorBase Community Representative, Jason Meyer, at meyerjm@purdue.edu
