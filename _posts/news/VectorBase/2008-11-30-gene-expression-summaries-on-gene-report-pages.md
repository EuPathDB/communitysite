We have now integrated a tabular text summary of microarray-based gene expression data on every gene report page (also known as GeneView).   Scroll down to the "Gene DAS Report" panel, check the box next to "Gene Expression Summary" and click on "Update".  After the page has refreshed you will see a list of experiments where significant differential expression has been observed.  Click on the experiment names to see more details of the expression profiles and statistics.
<p>Note that in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> there are many genes without microarray reporters, and therefore data, at the moment, so your mileage may vary. (More data is coming soon, however.)  We have no microarray data at all for <i>Culex pipiens</i> yet.
