<i>Anopheles gambiae</i> expression data from two recent publications has been added to VectorBase.   The work by Marco Neira Oviedo and colleagues has compared larval salivary gland gene expression to the whole organism.   Yury Goltsev and colleagues have measured gene expression during embryonic development and also profiled the cells which form the embryonic serosa (egg shell).
