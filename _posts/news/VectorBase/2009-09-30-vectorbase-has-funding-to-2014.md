We would like to announce to the current and future VectorBase user  \r\ncommunity that NIAID/NIH has formally renewed the VectorBase contract  for another 5 year cycle starting on 1 October 2009.  We would  especially like to thank the many members of the genomics and vector biology communities who provided letters and email messages endorsing the VectorBase renewal proposal.
