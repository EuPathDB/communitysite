We are aware the there are some issues with our BLAST tool at the moment.
<p>Since the installation of a newer, faster, application server, the TomCat sotfware (for running Java applications) is not behaving as expected and will sometimes stops completely, preventing any BLAST jobs to be submitted. We are working on this and are trying to figure out what is happening.<p>
Restarting the server is enough to solve the problem (temporarily) so please let us know if you can't run any BLAST jobs by contacting info@vectorbase.org
