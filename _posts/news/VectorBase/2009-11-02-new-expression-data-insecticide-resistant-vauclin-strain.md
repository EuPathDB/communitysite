Detoxification genes were assayed for expression differences between two strains of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>: Vauclin, from Martinique, which is resistant to temephos and deltamethrin insecticides, and Bora-bora, which is susceptible to insecticides, in both larvae and adults.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/494">open access article</a> can be found here, and many of the genes mentioned in the paper now have official VectorBase gene symbols, so you can locate their expression pages easily with the following style of URL: <a href="http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/ExpressionData/gene/CYP6M6">http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/ExpressionData/gene/CYP6M6</a>.
