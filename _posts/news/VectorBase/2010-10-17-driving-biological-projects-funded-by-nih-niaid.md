VectorBase is pleased to announce our first two Driving Biological Projects (DBP) funded by NIH/NIAID on the recommendation by the VectorBase Scientific Working Group (<a href="/about/">SWG</a>). All data generated by these funded DBPs will be made publicly available on VectorBase:<br /><br/>
<ul>
<li>Comparative Neurotranscriptome of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (<a href="/content/comparative-neurotranscriptome-aedes-aegypti">PDF</a>)
<li>Physical Reference Maps for Vector Genome Assembly (<a href="/content/physical-reference-maps-vector-genome-assembly">PDF</a>)
</ul>
<br />
Please contact us at info@vectorbase.org if you have any questions.  We expect the next call for proposals to be announced with the next 18 months.
