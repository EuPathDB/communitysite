<p>A <b>new <em>Aedes aegypti</em> gene set</b> (AaegL1.3) has just been released. It is a patch to the previous one, with the incorporation of about 50 community genes: 10 are new genes, the others are improvement to existing gene models. The total number of protein coding genes for this organism is slightly below 16,000. 

<p>As well as updating the gene set, we also re-ran the Xrefs, linking genes to external databases, and the Compara pipeline, updating the ortholog/paralog relationships with the other VectorBase species and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.</p>
