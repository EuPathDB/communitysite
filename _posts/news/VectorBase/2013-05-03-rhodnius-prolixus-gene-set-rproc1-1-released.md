---
The first release of the reference <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> gene set, <a href="/organisms/rhodnius-prolixus/cdc/RproC1.1">RproC1.1</a>. A period of community appraisal and re-annotation to improve and validate important loci resulted in 17,143 gene predictions, 15,429 of which are protein-coding. The transcript and peptide sequences are available for search via BLAST and download from the VectorBase site. Comparative analysis of the peptide sequences with other vector species has been performed to generate gene trees where appropriate.
