<p>Dear VectorBase users,</p>
 
<p>We want to share our new year's resolution.</p>  
 
<p>The main goal of VectorBase is to be the primary source of bioinformatic resources for the vector community. However, to accomplish this goal we need your help. This month, January 2014, we will start a “Scientific User Group” and we are inviting you to be part of it. We welcome the involvement of PIs and other senior scientists, however, we are particularly interested in the scientists who actively use VectorBase such as students, postdocs and laboratory technicians.</p>
 
<p>We plan to get your feedback every two to four months, following VectorBase releases (Release Page, <a href="www.vectorbase.org/releases">www.vectorbase.org/releases</a>). If you would like to be part of this group please send us a confirmation email and attach your answer to these four questions by January 22nd if possible:</p>
 
<ul> <li>What are VectorBase most important features, data sets or tools and resources? Please list 3 to 5 only. </li> <li>What new features could make your research (and life) easier? Please list 3 to 5 only. </li><li>Do you have any question about our latest release? (VB release 2013-12, <a href="www.vectorbase.org/release/release-vb-2013-12 ">www.vectorbase.org/release/release-vb-2013-12 </a>)</li><li>Do you have any question about anything on VectorBase that you need help with or you are just curious about?</li> </ul>
 
<p>We plan to have our 1st (1 hour) <strong>online</strong> meeting by the end of January (February is plan B). Please answer this doodle poll and let us know your availability in order to chose the best day for most people:
