title: Comparative analysis of response to selection with three insecticides in the
category: [VectorBase]
---
<em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes response to selection with 3 common insecticides was monitored using mRNA sequencing in a recent paper by David et. al. (2014). In collaboration with the authors VectorBase has aligned the RNAseq datasets to the <em>Aedes</em> genome and gene expression levels are available through the <a href="http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/expression-browser/next-gen">Gene expression</a> pages.
