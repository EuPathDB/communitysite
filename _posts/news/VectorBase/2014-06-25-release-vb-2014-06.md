<li>Eighteen more insecticide resistance data from the original IRBase resource are now available in our new <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/popbio">Population Biology</a>  resource.  This will immediately allow new visualizations and will allow building integrated views of genetic, resistance and even pathogen data.</li>

<li>We are hosting the annotation software <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/webapollo">Web Apollo</a>, the manual annotations created here will be collected by VectorBase to update the gene sets, you do not need to submit any files to us. As a transition period, during the next two months we will continue to receive GFF3 files for gene annotations generated with softwares such as Artemis.</li>
<li>The Ensembl genome browser has been updated to version 75.  New features include the ability to define a region to view/annotate in our new WebApollo instances.</li>
<li>Seven of the tutorials and/or their practice exercises have been updated for this release. Additionally, we are also providing a link to <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/tutorials/manual-annotation-web-apollo">Web Apollo user guide</a>. </li>
