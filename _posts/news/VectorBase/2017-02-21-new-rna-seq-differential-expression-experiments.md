<p align="justify">Links within the expression browser to experiment pages have now been shortened and simplified. This should make it more convenient to send URLs to colleagues. The experiments listed below are using the new shorter links. These are the four new RNAseq experiments processed and added to the expression browser: 

<ul> 
<li><em>Anopheles stephensi</em> male vs female (Jiang et al., 2015) </li>
<li><em>Aedes aegypti</em>  embryonic development (Hall et al., 2015) </li>
<li><em>Aedes aegypti</em> male vs female (Jiang et al., 2015) </li>
<li><em>Aedes aegypti</em> larval midgut response to Cry11Aa toxin (Canton et al., 2015) </li>
</ul>
