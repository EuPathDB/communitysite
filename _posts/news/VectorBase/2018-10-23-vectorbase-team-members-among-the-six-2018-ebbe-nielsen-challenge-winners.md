<h3>Smart mosquito trap to DwC pipeline</h3>
<p align="justify">Can smart sensors automate the capture of standardized time-series species occurrence data? For their Challenge entry, Connor Howington and Samuel Rund from VectorBase.org have developed a workflow for processing real-time time abundance data gathered by commercially available devices for remote mosquito monitoring. The routine starts with pulling data from the BG-Counterâ€™s proprietary API, condensing, cleaning and processing it to align with the open Darwin Core format. Their proof of concept represents a timely first step in preparing standardized open data from smart traps, given that next-generation sensors in development analyze wing-beat frequency to provide accurate species-level identifications.
