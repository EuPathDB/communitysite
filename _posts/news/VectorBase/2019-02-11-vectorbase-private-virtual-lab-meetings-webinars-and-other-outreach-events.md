<p style="text-align:justify">Dear VectorBasers,

<p style="text-align:justify">We invite you all to schedule a VectorBase <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/virtual-lab-meetings-0"><u>virtual lab meeting</u></a>. This is a private webinar for individuals or lab groups. If instead of a private session you prefer to attend public events, the VectorBase 2019 <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/vectorbase-2019-webinar-series-toolresource-specific"><u>tool/resource specific</u></a> and <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/vectorbase-2019-webinar-series-speciesgroup-specific"><u>species/group specific</u></a> webinar sessions, each with seven and eight different events respectively, may be for you. Sign up is required but attendance is free. Registration ends the day before each webinar session. Each registered participant will receive an email with connection details. 

<p style="text-align:justify">Plus <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops"><u>on this page</u></a>, you can see our outreach calendar, for information about VectorBase workshops and meeting to which we plan to attend this year. 
We look forward to seeing you in any of our outreach events!

<p style="text-align:justify">Enjoy,
<p style="text-align:justify">The VectorBase team
