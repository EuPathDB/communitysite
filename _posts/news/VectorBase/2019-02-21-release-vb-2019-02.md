We are pleased to announce the February 2019 release of VectorBase (VB-2019-02):
<ul>
<li>In this release there were updates to the gene sets for 7 species based on community annotation ( <i>
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-arabiensis">An. arabiensis</a>, 
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-coluzzii">An. coluzzii</a>, 
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-funestus">An. funestus</a>, 
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-gambiae">An. gambiae</a>, 
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-merus">An. merus</a>,
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-quadriannulatus">An. quadriannulatus</a> and
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/stomoxys-calcitrans">Stomoxys calcitrans</a>  </i>).
</li>
<li><a href="https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/count.html">HTseq read depth statistics</a> are now generated for all RNAseq alignments and can be accessed via the RNAseq experiment pages in the search facility (see also the <a href="/tutorials/tools-and-resources-tutorials/transcript-data-and-resources-microarrays-and-rnaseq">RNAseq tutorial</a>).</li>
<li>As part of our <a href="/news/important-vectorbase-merge-eupathdb">planning for contract renewal</a> we are discontinuing Apollo patch builds from the February 2019 release. The Apollo system will still be open to the community to make gene model edits, but these alterations will not be committed back into the VectorBase databases until Apollo has been transferred to the new contract holder. We currently anticipate that Apollo patch builds will commence from March 2020.</li>
<li>Following the introduction of the <a href="/tutorials/tools-and-resources-tutorials/variation">variation search facility</a> in August 2018 the current variation mart support will be discontinued from the April 2019 release as <a href="/release/release-vb-2018-10">noted in the October 2018 release notes</a>.</li>
<li>Updates to gene expression metrics as a consequence of the gene set updates for all species</li>
<li>20 years of mosquito surveillance data from Iowa, USA. (1998-2017)</li>
<li>Mosquito surveillance data from Ada County, Idaho (2017-18)</li>
<li>The Apollo annotation tool was updated to version 2.2.0</li>
<li>PopBio Map bug fixes and improvements such as the Share Link button now capturing optimized colors and plot changes, the plots can now be limited to show the top 14 categories of the data being graphed, and UX/UI improvements</li>
<li>The schedule for the <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops"><u>2019 outreach activities</u></a>  is available, and it features a calendar for your convenience. Meetings we plan to attend to host a booth, present a talk and/or poster include AMCA Feb 25-Mar 1, AGS June 12-14, VectorBiTE June 17-22, ISOPS July 15-19 and Mosquito and other vectors July 22-26. A <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/vectorbase-hands-workshop-0"><u>workshop in Guatemala</u></a>, June 3-5. Private webinars -<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/virtual-lab-meetings-0"><u>Virtual lab meetings</u></a> from Feb 1 to Sep 13. Public webinars - <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/vectorbase-2019-webinar-series-toolresource-specific"><u>tool/resource specific</u></a> and <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/vectorbase-2019-webinar-series-speciesgroup-specific"><u>species/group specific</u></a> sessions, each with seven and eight different events respectively from Feb 5 to Sep 10.</li>
