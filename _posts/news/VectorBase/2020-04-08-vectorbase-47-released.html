<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<p><strong>We are pleased to announce the release of VectorBase 47.</strong><br><br>  The product of 6 months of 
  back-end infrastructure work, Release 47 includes <a href="https://beta.vectorbase.org" target="_blank">beta.vectorbase.org</a> 
  in addition to our legacy sites. The beta site features an updated and streamlined interface that emphasizes 
  easy access to tools and help information. Release 47 also contains these changes:
    <ul>
      <li>The beta site contains the same Release 46 (i.e., Release VB-2019-08) genomes, transcriptomes and population biology data.  Proteomics will be integrated in a later release.</li>
      <li>Many new tools and functions that enhance data analyses are available, including Companion, EuPaGDT, Pub Med and Entrez search 
        crawler, and Search Strategies.</li> 
      <li>Many familiar tools remain, including Apollo, BLAST, Galaxy, Genome Browser, 
      MapVEu (previously PopBio map), Sequence retrieval, and REST web services. </li>
      <li>These tools have been retired: BioMart, ClustalW, Hmmer, Expression Browser and map, Ontology Browser and Sample and Genotype Explorer.</li> 
    </ul>
  </p>
<p>
  Your feedback is invaluable as we improve our sites and transition to our new interface.  So please try 
  <a href="https://beta.vectorbase.org" target="_blank">beta.vectorbase.org</a> and let us know how we are 
  doing by completing one or all of the surveys below.  Each takes about half an hour to complete.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cumyAxYi8ybn6Bv" target="_blank">Home page survey</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6ziJ958a9hclGFn" target="_blank">Site search survey</a> </li>
      <li><a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b33t5gs2DePPnox" target="_blank">Search strategy system survey</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    If you open the link first just to browse all the questions and pages, notice that the next time you open the survey to 
    provide your answers, your browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox), will land by default in the last page you visited. We apologize 
    for this inconvenience and ask for you to please clear your browser history, reload the page, scroll to the bottom of the 
    page and be sure to click the ‘back’ button to start from the first page.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
