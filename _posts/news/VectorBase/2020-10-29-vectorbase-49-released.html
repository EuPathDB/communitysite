  <h3>New features in {{project}} 49</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li>When revisiting a search page, your previous parameter values are automatically loaded.  This is especially useful for the BLAST search which now retains the input sequence.  </li>
    <li>The cytoscape drawing on metabolic pathway record pages now contains:
      <ul>
      <li>a new search function for finding nodes within the drawing.  After running a search, the drawing centers on the nodes which match the search term and highlights them with a bold green border.</li>
      <li>a "Reset Layout" button that will clear all node paintings as well as reset the node positions and zoom levels.</li>
      <li>a checkbox for toggling your mouse function between zooming the drawing or scolling the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data set and Organism record pages now contain direct links to our Downloads section where the option is available to download genome-scale sequence and annotation files.  </li>
   </ul>

    <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
