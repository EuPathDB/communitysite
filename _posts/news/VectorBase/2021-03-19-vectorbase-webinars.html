<p>We are happy to invite you to attend four sessions using our new website. All four events are designed for new users, assuming you have no previous knowledge of our new website. We kindly remind you that this year the VectorBase legacy site will be shut down, and we want to help you make the transition as easy as possible.</p>

<p>Events are scheduled on <b>Thursdays, 10 AM USA Eastern Time</b>. We strongly value your participation and are looking forward to all your questions and feedback during our live sessions, but if you are unable to attend or will like to watch a session again, they will all be recorded.</p> 

<p>Registration and webinar recordings, for this and our previous events, are available on  <a href="www" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>  

<p>Please feel free to share this message to your students, friends, and colleagues!</p>

  <h3>Content migration from legacy to beta VectorBase</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    We continue to migrate all the content from the legacy site before it is shut down, next on our list are cell line genomes (available in legacy BLAST), transcriptomes (available in the Expression Browser, Genome Browser track hubs, Downloads), proteome datasets and the Image Gallery. Please let us know which tool, resource, or dataset we might be missing or needs to be prioritized for migration.

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 51</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li><a href="/a/app/workspace/blast/new" target="_blank">BLAST<i><sup>beta</sup></i> tool</a> &ndash; a new BLAST tool with multi-BLAST capabilities.  Input a single sequence or several FASTA-formatted sequences at once.  Our tool uses NCBI BLAST to find genes, genomic sequences, ESTs, or PopSet Sequences that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence.  <a href="https://youtu.be/mEjt8FhC-W8" target="_blank">BLAST<i><sup>beta</sup></i> video introduction (4 min)</a>  </li>
    <li><a href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/VEuPathDB_BRC4_usage_metrics_report.pdf">Usage</a> and <a href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/VEuPathDB_BRC4_performance_metrics_report.pdf">performance</a> metrics for VEuPathDB sites are now updated monthly.  </li>
    <li>Community annotations made in {{project}} via Apollo are now represented on gene pages in the Gene Models graphic. In addition, links from the gene page to Apollo are offered to facilitate community annotations. <a href="{{'/assets/images/51-apollo-news.png' | absolute_url}}">Example image.</a>  Please see our <a href="https://youtu.be/RMXZDBMh8Fo" target="_blank">Apollo webinar</a> for instruction. </li>
