<p>We are happy to invite you to attend four sessions using our new website. All four events are designed for new users, assuming you have no previous knowledge of our new website. We kindly remind you that this year the VectorBase legacy site will be shut down, and we want to help you make the transition as easy as possible.</p>

<p>Events are scheduled on <b><u>Thursdays, 10 AM USA Eastern Time</u></b>. We strongly value your participation and are looking forward to all your questions and feedback during our live sessions, but if you are unable to attend or will like to watch a session again, they will all be recorded.</p> 

<p>Registration and webinar recordings, for this and other events, are available on  <a href="https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/webinars.html" target="_blank"><u>this page</u></a>.</p>
