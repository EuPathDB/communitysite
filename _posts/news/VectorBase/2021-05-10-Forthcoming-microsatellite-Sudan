<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<p>Microsatellite data from Sudan 
corresponding to a forthcoming publication from which the investigators are 
Bashir Salim (Project PI) and Mohammed-Ahmed B. Elnour (Co-Investigator), both from the University of Khartoum (Sudan), 
and Jeffrey R. Powell (Co-Investigator) and Andrea Gloria-Soria (Co-Investigator), both from Yale University (USA).  
This data set will made publicly available in a forthcoming VectorBase release. 

The research authors used 12 microsatellites loci to examine the population genetic and population history of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Sudan. 
Our findings indicated the presence of two subspecies, population structure and recent independent colonization events of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> in Sudan. 
<i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes were collected from eastern Sudan 
(Kassala and Port Sudan cities) and western Sudan (Al Fashir and Nyala cities), during November 2018- February 2020.

It has been pre-assigned Population Biology Project ID VBP0000762.<br><br>
