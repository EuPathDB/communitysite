<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<p>Microsatellite data from Sudan 
corresponding to a forthcoming publication from 
Bashir Salim (Project PI) from the University of Khartoum, Sudan. This data set will be made publicly available in a forthcoming VectorBase release.

<p>
The research authors used 12 microsatellites loci to examine the population genetic and population history of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Sudan. 
  The mosquito samples were collected from eastern Sudan 
(Kassala and Port Sudan cities) and western Sudan (Al Fashir and Nyala cities), during November 2018- February 2020.
