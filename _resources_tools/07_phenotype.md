<p>Phenotype data types include high-throughput phenotyping using RNAi target sequencing, whole genome knockout collections, piggyBac insertion mutagenesis, manually curated phenotypes by VEuPathDB and other resources (e.g. PHI-Base) and more.</p>
<p>Use phenotype data to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search for genes based on the observable characteristics of genetic manipulations, outcomes of host-pathogen interactions, CRISPR and quantitative phenotypes. <a href="#"><b>Example of Phenotype Datasets</b></a></li>  
  <li>View text and image data associated with various phenotype collections on individual gene record pages. <a href="#"><b>Example of Phenotype section on a gene record page</b></a></li>
  <li>Create search strategies to cross-reference your results with other VEuPathDB manually curated or user submitted phenotypes.</li>
</ul>
