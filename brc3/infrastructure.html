          <b>Data Loading and Database Schema</b><br><br>We use the <b>G</b>enomics <b>U</b>nified <b>S</b>chema (GUS) database schema and data loading infrastructure available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gusdb.org">GusDB.org</a>.  This includes not only a comprehensive database schema for integrating and representing genomic and functional (or post) genomic data but also tools for loading said data into that system.  We have made some extensions to the schema and tools for EuPathDB specific purposes primarily to generate de-normalized views of the data for query optimization purposes.</p><br>
          <p>Our data are all stored in Oracle12c databases.  Our software infrastructure also supports PostgreSQL but we have some Oracle specific SQL constructs in our model that would need to be changed in order to run successfully in PostgreSQL.  </p><br>
          <p>We load all data using an in house engineered workflow system called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/ReFlow">ReFlow</a>.  Briefly, ReFlow is engineered to be an efficient graph-based workflow system. In it each step (node in the graph) has the ability to be undone and subsequently rerun with updated data.  This was a significant requirement as it enables us to undo entire genomes when the annotation or underlying sequence changes.  This results in automated removal of all data dependent on that genome. When the step is re-run with the new annotation, all dependent data are recomputed and reloaded automatically, thus greatly improving our ability to keep these complex databases up-to-date.</p><br>
          <p>The ReFlow workflow system utilizes another piece of software developed at the University of Pennsylvania to schedule, manage and monitor running tasks called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fpub%3Fid%3D1BixZ5t2c0hnOZES-Rk2wG2loAQqclcmRj7AeKQjZMHA">DistribJob</a>.  DistribJob distributes tasks generated from a large input dataset such as a set of sequences to compute nodes in a cluster for analysis and retrieves and collates the results in an efficient manner. We automate the running of large compute tasks on compute clusters located at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia.</p>

          <b>Web Presentation System and User Interfaces</b><br><br><p>Our websites are based on code that we developed and have released to the community called the Strategies-WDK (Strategies Web Development Kit) which enables the graphical strategies search system.  You can download the software and see documentation for this toolkit at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/WDK">Strategies-WDK</a>.  This toolkit enables us to represent our data as an XML model which is then turned into the web interfaces that are presented to users using these tools.</p>

          <b>System Hardware and Third Party Software</b><br><br><p>
          EuPathDB maintains redundant database and content web servers at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia to minimize interruptions for our users during maintenance periods. Additionally EuPathDB compute and data loading servers are located at the University of Pennsylvania. 
          <br><br>
          Server configurations are coordinated and deployed through Puppet automation software (<a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">http://puppetlabs.com/</a>). Custom infrastructure software is versioned and deployed through standard RPM/YUM mechanisms. When appropriate, software builds are automated using Jenkins Continuous Integration Server (<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank">http://jenkins-ci.org/</a>)
          <br><br> 
          System infrastructure statistics (CPU load, I/O, etc) are gathered with collectd (<a href="http://collectd.org/" target="_blank">http://collectd.org/</a>) and in-house applications and feed to Graphite (<a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">http://graphite.wikidot.com/</a>) for human review. Nagios (<a href="http://www.nagios.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nagios.org/</a>) provides notifications of system degradations.
          <br><br>
          Both Universities also maintain large compute clusters that are heavily utilized by EuPathDB in order to analyze and load incoming data in a timely fashion. The linked document below describes our actual hardware and includes a list of third-party software required in order to analyze, load and present data via our websites.
