    <h3>AmoebaDB 29</h3>
           AmoebaDB 29 represents extensive efforts to improve navigation and data accessibility 
           on record pages, provide consistent verbiage and data categories, and improve presentation of alternative transcripts. 
           All data were refreshed to the latest version and genome analyses were rerun.

      <h3>New Features</h3>
         
           <ul>
             <li>Data Categories - <br>Searches, data and GBrowse tracks are now categorized according to the 
             <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/EDAM?iri=http://edamontology.org/topic_3070">EMBRACE Data & Methods Ontology (EDAM)</a>. 
             This offers a controlled vocabulary and consistent data structure throughout the site. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Record Pages Redesigned - <br>Gene pages, and in-fact all our record pages, have a new structure. 
             Features include a new streamlined and uncluttered look, new navigation tools, and improved 
             tables with search functions for quickly finding and displaying the data you want. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Transcripts Represented on Gene Pages and Search Results - <br>Transcripts are graphically represented on 
             gene pages and listed in gene page tables when data can be 
             unambiguously assigned to a transcript. All search results now 
             contain a Transcript ID column.  The results of searches that query transcript-specific 
             data (e.g. Predicted Signal Peptide) contain an Explore function for investigating transcript subsets.
             </li><br>
             <li>Galaxy Workspace - <br> EuPathDB sites now include a Galaxy-based workspace for large-scale data analyses. 
             Developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.globus.org/genomics">Globus Genomics</a>, 
             workspaces offer a private analysis platform with published workflows and pre-loaded annotated genomes. 
             The workspace is accessed through the "Analyze My Experiment" tab on the home page of any EuPathDB resource 
             and can be used to upload your own data, compose and run custom workflows, retrieve results and share 
             workflows and data analyses with colleagues.
             </li><br>
             <li>Download Search Result Redesigned - <br>The page for downloading search results and associated data has 
             an improved design that reflects the new ontological data categories and offers the ability to download 
             all transcripts per gene when downloading gene results.
             </li><br>
             <li>RNA Sequencing Workflow - We updated our RNA sequencing analysis. The new workflow aligns 
             reads with GSNAP, calculates FPKM/RPKM from HT-Seq counts and determines differential expression with DESeq2.

        Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
        Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
        When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
        When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
