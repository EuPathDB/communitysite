      <li>We have added links to external 'Global Health Data Resources' on our 'Tutorials and Resources' 
        page, such as sites providing education on data science and epidemiology, data management 
        best practices, and visualizations of global health data. To access these links, hover

      <li>Improvements have been made to the histograms for variables with continuous data. 
        You can now interact with how the data in these histograms is displayed by selecting the 
        range of the data you would like included on the x-axis, change the size of the interval 
        bins, zoom in or out by adjusting the y-axis, or choose to display on a log or linear 
        scale.</li>
