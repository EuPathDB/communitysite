title: GiardiaDB 1.0 is released
category: [GiardiaDB]
---

We are pleased to announce that GiardiaDB is now available at <a href="http://giardiadb.org/">www.giardiadb.org</a>.  GiardiaDB is now part of ApiDB (<a href="http://apidb.org">www.apidb.org</a>) and funded by <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/brc/default.htm">NIH's BRC program</a>.
<br><br>
The previous GiardiaDB, hosted by the MBL's Bay Paul Center, will remain available until the end of 2007.  During this transition period, we ask that you use <a href="http://giardiadb.org/">www.giardiadb.org</a> and notify us if there is a feature, tool, or query that you need that is not available at the new site.  Please send a message to the support team from the link at the bottom of the GiardiaDB web page (<a href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">Contact Us!</a>).
<br><br>
GiardiaDB 1.0 provides the genome and annotation for the the eukaryotic parasite Giardia lamblia ATCC50803, WBC6 isolate, generated at the MBL and just reported in Science (Science 28 September 2007, Volume 317, pp. 1921-1926).   Also provided are expression data from EST and SAGE surveys.
<br><br>
GiardiaDB, like the other ApiDB sites, offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify G. lamblia genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; transcript expression evidence (ESTs and SAGE tags); physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  In addition, GiardiaDB contains pre-computed phylogenetic trees for proteins with homologues in other eukaryotic genomes.
