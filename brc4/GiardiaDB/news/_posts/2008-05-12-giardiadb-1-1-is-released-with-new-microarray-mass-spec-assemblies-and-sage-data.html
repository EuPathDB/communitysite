title: GiardiaDB 1.1 is released with new Microarray, Mass Spec., Assemblies and SAGE
category: [GiardiaDB]

We are pleased to announce that GiardiaDB is now available at <a href="http://giardiadb.org/">www.giardiadb.org</a>.  GiardiaDB is now part of ApiDB/EuPathDB (<a href="http://eupathdb.org">www.eupathdb.org</a>) and funded by <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/brc/default.htm">NIH's BRC program</a>.

  Please send a message to the support team from the link at the bottom of the GiardiaDB web page (<a href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">Contact Us!</a>).
<br><br>
GiardiaDB 1.1 provides the genome and annotation for the the eukaryotic parasite Giardia lamblia ATCC50803, WBC6 isolate, generated at the MBL and just reported in Science (Science 28 September 2007, Volume 317, pp. 1921-1926). 
<p>New data available in this release includes: 
<ul>
  <li>Genes which were subsumed or largely overlapping with longer genes or genes with more evidence were marked as deprecated and all gene queries allow users to choose whether to query for these genes or not.
  <li>Ten SAGE tag libraries are now available with queries and record pages.
  <li>Microarry data from experiments examining stress induction in trophozoites.
  <li>Proteomics data from trophozoites.
  <li>All locations are reported on scaffolds but also available in contig coordinates.
</ul>
GiardiaDB, like the other ApiDB/EuPathDB sites, offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify G. lamblia genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; transcript expression evidence (ESTs and SAGE tags); physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  In addition, GiardiaDB contains pre-computed phylogenetic trees for proteins with homologues in other eukaryotic genomes.
