title: GiardiaDB 1.1 Updated
category: [GiardiaDB]
---

We are pleased to announce an update to GiardiaDB 1.1, which mainly affects the number of deprecated genes available through GiardiaDB and how query results are displayed.
<p>
1. In this release, all genes that were available through the genome project database (MBL GiardiaDB) are now included in GiardiaDB.  Hence, there are 4778 deprecated genes in this release.
<p>
2. When performing a query, you no longer select whether to query genes only, deprecated genes only, or both.  Instead, when a query is performed, all results will be returned with the option to view (or filter) all results, genes only or deprecated genes only (“genes only” is the default view of the results).
<p>
As a reminder, deprecated genes were labeled as such because they appear unlikely to represent true genes, based on incompatibility with longer gene models or alternative models for which functional evidence is available. A number of deprecated genes may in fact be true genes and as evidence becomes available to support this, we will elevate a deprecated gene to a "full" gene status.  We encourage users to notify us of such evidence by email or by adding specific user comments gene pages.
