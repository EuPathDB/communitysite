<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of GiardiaDB 2.0<br>
<br>
</span>This is a major release of GiardiaDB that includes several
new data types:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Genome sequence and annotation of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Giardia</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">intestinalis</span>
assemblage B isolate GS. &nbsp;For further information please refer
to the publication: <a
 href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19696920">Draft
genome sequencing of giardia intestinalis assemblage B isolate GS: is
human giardiasis caused by two different species? PLoS Pathog. 2009
Aug;5(8):e1000560 Franzén et al.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sequence and annotation of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Giardia</span> assemblage
E isolate P15 was provided by J. Jerlstrom-Hultqvist. O. Franzen, E.
Castro, J. Ankarklev, D. Palm, J. O. Andersson, S.G. Svard and B.
Andersson (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden and Uppsala
University, Uppsala, Sweden). The genome sequence and annotation was
graciously provided to GiardiaDB prepublication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">note: genomic data may be
searched in many ways such as identifying all genes from any of the
assemblages, searching for genes using the text search or identifying
genes from one assemblage based on functional data in another using
orthology. &nbsp;In addition, all gene pages include a genomic
context view </span><span style="font-style: italic;">highlighting
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">synteny
between the three assemblages in GiardiaDB.&nbsp; </span></div>
<ul>
  <li>Additional stress induction microarray data graciously
provided by Cornelia Spycher and Adrian Hehl prepublication (University
of Zürich, Switzerland). &nbsp;Genes may be identified based on
their expression profile by running one of the&nbsp;<a
 href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence&amp;target=GENE">microarray
searches </a>and results may be combined with other searches in
GiardiaDB.</li>
</ul>
Additional features and Improvements:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>1012 genes from Giardia lamblia assemblage A isolate WB
have been undeprecated based on synteny to assemblage B and E genomes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Representation of SAGE tag data on gene pages has been
improved providing graphical representation of tag counts over the life
cycle of the parasite.</li>
</ul>
