      <h4>Annotated Genomes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_3a6ccbfbcf"><i>Monocercomonoides exilis</i> strain PA203</a> &ndash; 
                  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185558" target="_blank">Karnkowska et al. 2016</a> and 
				  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387118" target="_blank">Karnkowska et al. 2019</a> 
              </li>
            </ul>      
      <h4>Quantitative Proteomics</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_587864765f">Nitro drug-resistant strains and wild type proteomics</a> &ndash;   
                  Three <i>Giardia Assemblage A</i> isolate WB lines that are resistant to metranidazole, WB MtzR, 106 MtzR and 713 MtzR, were analyzed by quantitative proteomics and for post-translational modifications.

      <h3><b>New features in GiardiaDB 46</b></h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
         <ul>
           <li>
             Copy Number Variation Pipeline Bug Fix:  To correct skewed copy number predictions, we changed the method for counting reads in our 
			 CNV pipeline from Cufflinks to HTSeq-Count.  In our new pipeline we calculate FPKM manually.  Please note - saved strategies 
			 that include CNV searches will likely produce different results in Release 46. 
           </li>
		   <li>
             Our pipeline of genomic analyses includes open reading frames (ORFs) prediction in addition to loading gene models from the official annotation.  
			 Because data usage analysis showed low ORF usage, in our next release (47) predicted ORFs will be available as a genome-scale fasta file from 
			 our downloads section and removed  from the searches and genome browser.  Please <a href="https://eupathdb.org/eupathdb/app/contact-us" target ="_blank"> Contact Us</a> 
			 with questions or suggestions.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
