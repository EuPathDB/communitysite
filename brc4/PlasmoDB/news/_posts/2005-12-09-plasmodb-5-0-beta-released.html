title: PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta released
category: [PlasmoDB]
---

We are pleased to announce Version 5.0 Beta of the Plasmodium Genome Database. We have incorporated into PlasmoDB the new release of the <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> genome and annotation generated by Jane Carlton's group and the sequencing center at The Institute for Genome Research. We have also used this release to change the way we create the web site and underlying database that should make it easier for us to generate new PlasmoDB releases and be consistent with other ApiDB projects such as CryptoDB and ToxoDB. As a result, we have focused on providing access to <i>P. vivax</i> through the PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta site but have not completely reproduced all the functions in PlasmoDB 4.4. Therefore we have kept the PlasmoDB 4.4 site fully active for continued use. Furthermore we have provided a mechanism to take the results of a PlasmoDB 4.4 query and use it in PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta.

PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta features:
<ul>
<li>A new interactive genome browser, based on the GBrowse module of the GMOD project, providing rapid visualization of the parasite genome and gene models, custom restriction site identification, open reading frame identification, and downloads in various formats.
<li>The complete genome sequence for P. vivax Salvador, along with a complete set of annotated gene models, and syntenic relationships between <i>P. falciparum, P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i> (from Jane Carlton, TIGR).
<li>Updated <i>P. falciparum</i> annotation, including curated literature citations; updated GO term curation from Andy Berry, Matt Berriman, and the Sanger curation effort; updated EC/pathway mappings from Hagai Ginsburg.
<li>TIGR Gene Indices for <i>P. vivax, P. falciparum, and P.yoelii</i>.
<li>Corrected expression profiles from glass-slide arrays for <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7, HB3 & Dd2 (from Manuel Llinas, Zybnek Bozdech & Joe DeRisi).
<li>Updated structural data, including information from the structural genomics consortia.
<li>Protein-protein interaction data for <i>P. falciparum</i>, based on a genome-wide yeast 2-hybrid analysis (LaCount et al. Nature 438:103; 2005).
<li>New ortholog analyses, using the OrthoMCL algorithm to group genes from several <i>Plasmodium</i> species with other complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (Chen et al. Nucl Acids Res, in press).
</ul><p>
Finally, we are pleased to report a new CD-ROM version of the Plasmodium Genome Database.  PlasmoCD provides users lacking reliable high-speed internet connections with full access to the complete genomes of <i>P. falciparum, P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i>, along with gene models, annotation, BLAST hits, ortholog results, expression data, and search functions for querying and integrating these results across species. PlasmoCD 4.1 can be downloaded from the PlasmoDB web site, or requested by sending e-mail to &lt;help@PlasmoDB.org&gt;.
