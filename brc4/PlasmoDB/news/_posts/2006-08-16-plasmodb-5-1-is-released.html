title: PlasmoDB 5.1 is released
category: [PlasmoDB]
---

The PlasmoDB 5.1 release continues our effort to add new data and features while migrating PlasmoDB 4.4 functionality to the PlasmoDB 5 architecture.  This release includes new rodent malaria parasite data, improved mappings to external sites, improvements to the Genome Browser, more 4.4 functionality (we're almost done with the migration) and some important behind the scenes improvements.

Here are the details:
  <ul>
  <li> Rodent malaria parasite (RMP) data
     <ul>
     <li> For <i>P. berghei</i> and <i>P. chabaudi</i>
        <ul> 
        <li> Genome Browser tracks showing synteny to <i>P. falciparum</i>
        <li> TIGR Gene Index (TGI) tracks in the Genome Browser
        <li> Pfam domains mapped to predicted protein products
        </ul>
     <li> A Genome Browser track showing glass slide array oligos mapped to <i>P. yoelii</i>
     </ul>
  <li> Updated mappings from PlasmoDB genes to
        <ul>
        <li>The Protein Data Bank (PDB)
        <li>Genbank, RefSeq and Swissprot
        <li>Reagents from the MR4 Consortium
        </ul>
  <li> tRNA gene predictions for <i>P. vivax</i>, <i>P. berghei</i>, <i>P. chabaudi</i> and <i>P. yoelii</i>.
  <li> Migrated functionality PlasmoDB 4.4
     <ul>
     <li> Array element pages that describe the details of oligos and their expression.
     <li> A protein secondary structure query and track on the gene page
     <li> Links from PlasmoDB genes to predicted protein structure models
     <li> The "Add a Comment" facility (for commenting on genes and chromosomes/contigs).  
     <li> A newly designed User Login process.  (In upcoming releases logging in to the site will let you store your query history and set preferences.  For now, it just lets you Add a Comment).
     </ul>
  <li> Genome Browser features
     <ul>
     <li> Save your favorite track configurations and regions of interest.
     <li> Download the sequence of any feature in any track
     </ul>     
  <li> Improved citations on the Data Sources page
  <li> Behind the scenes, a new issue tracking system so we can better respond to your support issues.
