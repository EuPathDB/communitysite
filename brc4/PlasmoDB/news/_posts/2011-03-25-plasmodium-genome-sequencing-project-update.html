<body>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Following extensive discussion with
the malaria research community, the list of Plasmodium genome
sequencing projects supported by the US National Institutes of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has been updated, replacing entries
that have been difficult to source with additional isolates and species
of interest.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The initial white paper is available <a style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/communityDownload.do?fname=Plasmodium_Sequencing_White_Paper.pdf">here</a>;
click <a style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/communityDownload.do?fname=Table2_021208_SampleStatus_032111%20SampleStatus.pdf">here</a>
for the revised list of approved projects. &nbsp;The Plasmodium
sequencing contract has been awarded to the <a
style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/science/projects/gscid/genomic-sequencing-center-infectious-diseases">Broad
Institute</a>, and data is made publicly available to the broader
research community via deposition in GenBank and through relevant <a
style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://rnaseq.pathogenportal.net/">Bioinformatics
Resource Centers</a>, including <a style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://PlasmoDB.org">PlasmoDB</a>. &nbsp;Further information on
the 'white paper' process by which key pathogen species are approved
for sequencing is available <a style="font-weight: bold;"
