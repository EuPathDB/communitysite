<b>We are pleased to
announce the implementation of new features in ToxoDB:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Now
after you perform a BlastN against genomic sequence you can link from
the blast output to the correct coordinates in the genome
browser.&nbsp;
This allows you to explore annotation and other functional data in
relation to your BLAST hits.</li>
  <li>Upadated product names for the Surface Antigen Glycoprotein
(SAG) Related Sequences (SRSs) (provided by Michael Grigg).</li>
  <li>The type ahead feature has been implemented for GO term, EC
number and Interpro domain searches.</li>
  <li>You can now edit or delete your user comments.</li>
  <li>You can now modify your user profile, change your password
or your email address.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Please also note that the parent portal site <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a> has just been
updated, offering you the ability to explore results across organisms.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
The EuPathDB team.
