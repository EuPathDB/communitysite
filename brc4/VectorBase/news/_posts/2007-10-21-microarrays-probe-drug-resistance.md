The sequencing of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> genome has equipped researchers at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (Dr. Hilary Ranson and Dr. Clare Strode) to design and produce a detox chip. This chip houses a complete set of cytochrome P450s, glutathione transferases (GSTs) and carboxyl esterases for the yellow fever mosquito.<br><br>As insecticides play a critical role in controlling vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, our interest lies in identifying the genes likely to confer metabolic resistance to insecticides. Using the detox chip we have identified a cohort of genes which were over expressed in two insecticide resistant populations originating from Thailand and Mexico. Of particular interest is the over expression of a large number of P450s which belong to the CYP9 (e.g. probe <a href="http://base.vectorbase.org/base/perl/expression-summary.cgi?reporter=aaeg-detox-2D7;species=Aedes_aegypti">aaeg-detox-2D7</a>) class and members of the epilson GST class (e.g. probe <a href="http://base.vectorbase.org/base/perl/expression-summary.cgi?reporter=aaeg-detox-1J3;species=Aedes_aegypti">aaeg-detox-1J3</a>) in resistant <i>Aedes</i>.  The detox chip will be used to monitor detoxification gene expression in <i>Aedes</i> populations worldwide with the aim of understanding the dynamics of insecticide resistance.
