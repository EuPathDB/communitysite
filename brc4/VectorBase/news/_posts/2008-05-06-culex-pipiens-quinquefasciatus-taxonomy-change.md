title: Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus taxonomy change

The NCBI has decided to follow the near-unanimous consensus in the taxonomic literature and promoted the subspecies <i>Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus</i> to species level, as <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>. The NCBI taxid will remain the same (7176).
VectorBase will reflect this taxonomy change some time in the future, but for the moment the web pages and file names at VectorBase will continue to use "<i>Culex pipiens</i>".  Gene, transcript and protein identifiers (CPIJxxxxxx), and the assembly identifier (CpipJ), will not be modified.
