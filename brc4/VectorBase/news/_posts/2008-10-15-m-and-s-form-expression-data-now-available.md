<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18430144">Cassone et al.</a> have performed expression profiling of several field strains of M and S form <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> mosquitoes.  Considered across all three developmental periods (presented as separate experiments in VectorBase), differentially expressed genes represented around 1a??2% of all expressed genes.  One prominent example is this <a href="http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/ExpressionData/gene/AGAP004690">cuticular protein</a> with much higher expression in the M-form compared to S.
