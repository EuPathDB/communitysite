In October 2008 VectorBase initiated a plan for the development of a web-based data repository for information about the population genomics of invertebrate vectors of human disease. This endeavor is being pursued via a subcontract with Dr. Gregory C. Lanzaro, University of California-Davis and Dr. Charles E. Taylor, University of California-Los Angeles.  Development of this new functionality of VectorBase will begin with a population genomics database for <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, now available at <a href="/popbio">VectorBase</a>.
<br /><br />
We have recently completed Stage 1 of this <i>An. gambiae</i> database. This first stage includes data for 5,870 individual <i>An. gambiae s.l.</i> collected from 54 sites in Mali and for 3,245 individuals from 51 sites in Cameroon. The data includes species identification (<i>An. gambiae</i> and <i>An. arabiensis</i>), molecular form (M vs. S), chromosomal form (Forest, Bamako, Mopti and Savanna) and karyotype.  A Google Maps API and GoogleEarth provide visualization of these data on maps. Full details on this new component of VectorBase are available <a href="/popbio/submission">here</a>.
<br /><br />
We are also developing a Workbench feature that will allow users to manage and manipulate their own data for ongoing studies. We have enlisted a small group of beta users for this feature and are currently inviting additional users to participate. If you are interested in participating as a beta user for the Workbench please contact us at: <a href="mailto:popgen@vectorbase.org">popgen at vectorbase dot org</a>.
