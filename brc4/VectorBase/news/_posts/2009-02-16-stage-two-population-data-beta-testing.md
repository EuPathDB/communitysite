We have recently completed  <a href="/popbio">Stage 1 of this population genomics database</a>
<br /><br />
Stage 2 of this system is being designed to store data for multiple taxa, and we are actively looking for users willing to submit vector population genetics data to VectorBase. To help facilitate this process, we are also developing a Workbench feature that will allow users to manage their own data. A small group of users have already been enlisted, but additional beta users are welcome. If you are interested in submitting data and/or in more information on participating as a beta user for the Workbench please contact us at: <a href="mailto:popgen@vectorbase.org">popgen at vectorbase dot org</a>
