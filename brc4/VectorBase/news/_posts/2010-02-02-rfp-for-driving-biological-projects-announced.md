<p>The NIAID-funded Bioinformatics Resource Center VectorBase invites proposals for Driving Biological Projects (*s) that focus on infectious diseases research related to human microbial pathogens and invertebrate vectors of human diseases.</p><p>DBPs must include research that uses high-throughput experimental technologies to functionally characterize the genome, proteome or metabolome to help elucidate how genes, proteins and metabolites may be involved in pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance or other biological processes of interest in the study of infectious diseases. HTP approaches to functional characterization of genes and proteins may include, for example, microarrays, mass spectrometry, two-hybrid screenings, RNAi experiments, Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq studies and bioassays.</p><p><a href="http://www.vectorbase.org/downloads/public_data/documents/Request_for_Proposals_VectorBase_DBP.pdf">Download the full RFP</a></p><p><a href="http://www.vectorbase.org/sections/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=715">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>
