A preliminary data set for Rhodnius prolixus is included in the VB-2011-02 release:
https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/rhodnius-prolixus<br><br>
The annotation of Rhodnius prolixus is in process.  At the present time, the following data are available:
<br>
<ul> - repeats (Dust, TRF, known repeated elements publicly available);</ul>
<ul> - alignments to 9,665 Rhodnius prolixus Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from dbEST mapped to the genome;</ul>
<ul> - alignments to 792,023 sequences from 2 Rhodnius prolixus RNA-seq datasets mapped to the genome;</ul>
<ul> - EST and RNA-seq derived gene set</ul>
<ul> - alignments to 143,631 proteins from Uniprot, grouped into 7 taxa, mapped to the genome</ul>
<ul> - 18,426 (Genscan http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) ab initio gene models</ul>
<br><br>
Be aware that the EST and RNA-seq derived genes are not part of the official gene set, their identifiers are not stable and there is no plan to maintain them.  
<br><br>
They have not been indexed as part of the site-wide search.
<br><br>
Note that VectorBase provides a Blast server to compare your sequence against the Rhodnius prolixus supercontigs.  
<br><br>
Raw and processed versions of the ESTs and RNA-seq datasets are available for (download /downloads/), as are the supercontigs.
<br><br>
A full genebuild will follow in a future VectorBase release.
