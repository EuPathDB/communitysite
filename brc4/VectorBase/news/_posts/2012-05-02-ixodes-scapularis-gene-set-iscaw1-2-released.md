<p>
VectorBase has just released a <b>new  <a href="/organisms/ixodes-scapularis/wikel/IscaW1.2"><em>Ixodes scapularis</em> gene set (IscaW1.2)</a></b>. It is a small patch to the previous one, with addition of 29 models submitted by the community, all of them being improvement to existing gene models. The number of genes for this species remains unchanged.
</p>  
<p>
As well as updating the gene set, we also re-ran the Xrefs, linking genes to external databases, and the Compara pipeline, updating the ortholog/paralog relationships with the other VectorBase species and <a href="http://metazoa.ensembl.org/Drosophila_melanogaster/Info/Index" class="external-nofollow"><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
The gene set is displayed via the <a href="/organisms/ixodes-scapularis">genome browser</a> and fasta files are downloadable from the <a href="/downloads/">Download section</a>.
