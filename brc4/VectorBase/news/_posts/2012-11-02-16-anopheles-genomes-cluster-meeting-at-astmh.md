You are cordially invited to attend a public forum regarding the status of the 16 Anopheles Genomes Cluster project to be held in conjunction with the upcoming ASTMH meeting in Atlanta:

Please join us on <strong>Monday, November 12, 2012, 12:30pm-1:30pm in Hilton Room 211.</strong>

We will summarize the project and its management team, present a tentative timeline for resource delivery, opportunities for community analysis of biological themes, and publication strategy.  We will be available to answer your questions.

For those unable to attend and for all who are interested in following our progress, please note that <strong>this information will be available on the Broad and VectorBase web sites. </strong>  We will continue to update it throughout the project.
