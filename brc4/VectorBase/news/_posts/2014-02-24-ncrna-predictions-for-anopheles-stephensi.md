The <a href="/info/genome/genebuild/ncrna.html">ncRNA pipeline</a> has been used to predict RNA genes from the <em>An. stephensi</em> Indian assembly AsteI2 and SDA-500 assembly AsteS1. This generated 561 predictions which have been included in the <a href="/organisms/anopheles-stephensi/indian/AsteI2.2">AsteI2.2</a> geneset and 537 predictions in the <a href="/organisms/anopheles-stephensi/sda-500/AsteS1.1">AsteS1.1</a> geneset.
