We dedicate this release of VectorBase to Dr. Martin Hammond, one time outreach officer, VectorBase gene builder, and eternally enthusiastic, inquisitive scientist. Martin passed away recently after a battle with motor neurone disease. Martin came to EMBL-EBI after many years teaching science at undergraduate level, joining the Ensembl team before becoming instrumental in the Anopheles gambiae project that developed into VectorBase. Post EMBL-EBI he returned to teaching at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. A keen cyclist with a keener mind, he is much missed.
