We are pleased to announce the February release of VectorBase (VB-2015-02):
<ul>
<li> Gene set updates have been produced for four <em>Glossina</em> species. Low quality gene models that lack support have been demoted for <em>Glossina austeni</em> (3051 genes), <em>G. brevipalpis</em> (4894 genes), <em>G. fuscipes</em> (3123 genes) and <em>G. pallidipes</em> (2653 genes).</li>
<li> New variation datasets for <em>Ixodes scapularis</em>.</li>
<li> The latest <em>Drosophila</em> assembly and gene set (FlyBase 6.02) have been used to construct updates to the proten coding gene trees, and new genome pairwise alignments between <em>D. melanogaster</em>, <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>, and <em>Aedes aegypti</em>.</li>
<li> Whole genome pairwise alignments have been constructed between all Anophelines in the <em>An. gambiae</em> complex (<em>An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii,  An. gambiae, An. melas, An. merus, An.quadriannulatus</em>), and between the different reference strains for <em>Anopheles sinensis</em> and <em>Anopheles stephensi</em>.</li>
<li>A major new differential gene expression via RNA-seq dataset has been added to the genome browser. Gene expression levels in a number of <em>Anopheles gambiae</em> cell lines are now available.
<li>Five new Web Apollo instances are available for access through <a href = '/webapollo'>Web Apollo</a>.</li>
<li>New versions of VectorBase-supported ontologies added to the ontology browser and also available for download.
<li>Spatial search by center geo-coordinates and radius is now available in Advanced Search for Population Biology data.
<li>Two new insecticide resistance studies added for South America.
<li>Please note that the VectorBase Galaxy server has been changed to an HTTPS connection. Please change your bookmarks to <a href="https://galaxy.vectorbase.org:8080">https://galaxy.vectorbase.org:8080</a>
<li>The Galaxy server has been updated to the latest software version (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist/src/d677cb314dccedd8743eba26f1d446cdf97ebf16/?at=latest_2015.01.13">January 2015 Stable Release</a>).
<li>New documentation material for gene manual annotations using <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/tutorials/community-annotation-tutorials/manual-annotation-web-apollo">Web Apollo</a>, which includes a decision tree, a video tutorial, practice exercises (in a demo site), updated <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/faqs#webapollo">FAQs</a> and more.  
<li>Check our tutorials section called <a href="/tutorials?qt-tutorials=3#qt-tutorials">"Other Bioinformatic Resources"</a>, in this release it includes resources for K-12 and undergraduates in the areas of genetics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics and genomics.
