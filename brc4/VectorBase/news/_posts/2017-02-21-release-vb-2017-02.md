We are pleased to announce the February 2017 release of VectorBase (VB-2017-02):
<ul>
<li>Updates to all species for RNA gene sets using alignment to Rfam (release 12.1) covariance models, and predictions from miRBase (release 21) and tRNAscan-SE (<a href="/faqs/how-are-rna-genes-annotated">Further details</a>).</li>
<li>Microarray probe mappings and variant effects have been updated for all species in light of the RNA gene model changes in this release</li>
<li>The xref entries for gene symbols are now only attached to genes, and are no longer attached to transcripts</li>
<li>New RNAseq track hub data has been added for the following species
<ul>  
  <li><i>Aedes aegypti </i>(+4 track hubs) </li>
  <li><i>Anopheles gambiae </i>(+3) </li>
  <li><i>Anopheles merus </i>(+2) </li>

  <li><i>Phlebotomus papatasi </i>(SRA version replacement)< /li>
</ul>
Please note that as stated in the August 2016 (2016-08) VectorBase release notes the old style RNAseq search interface has been retired, and all RNAseq search functionality has now been incorporated into the standard site search facility. RNAseq alignments are now derived from the HISAT pipeline, and the old alignments generated by other methods have been retired.
</li>
<li> Four new RNA-seq differential expression experiments added to the expression browser</li>
<li> Ten new population biology datasets added (and eight updated to improve data consistency)</li>
<li>The Web Apollo annotation tool has been upgraded to v2.0.5</li>
<li> The Galaxy tool has been upgraded to v16.10 </li> 
<li> Multiple minor updates have been made to the VectorBase search interface.
<li> Download limits removed for logged in users.  If you want an account, please contact us.
<li>New Web Apollo tutorial and PopBio video tutorial
<li>New pages with information about VectorBase <a href="/workshops/workshops_general">standard (in-person)</a> and <a href="/workshops/live-and-free-webinars">webinar</a> workshops.
