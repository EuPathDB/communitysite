<ul>

<li> A new assembly and gene set have been created for <i>Anopheles atroparvus</i> based on the paper "Partial-arm translocations in evolution of malaria mosquitoes revealed by high- coverage physical mapping of the Anopheles atroparvus genome" (Sharakov et al, BMC Genomics, manuscript submitted). </li>

<li>The AatrE2 assembly is a rescaffolding of the sequence of the previous AatrE1 assembly; this has lead to aleration to the genomic feature coordinates, but there have been no changes to the underlying sequences or gene content.</li>

</ul>
