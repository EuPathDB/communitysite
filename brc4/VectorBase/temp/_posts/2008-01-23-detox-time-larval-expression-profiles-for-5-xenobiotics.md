title: 'Detox time: larval expression profiles for 5 xenobiotics'

By using the Aedes detox chip microarray, researchers from the French Laboratory of Alpine Ecology of Grenoble (R. Poupardin, S. Reynaud and J.P. David), the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (C. Strode and H. Ranson) and the Greek Laboratory of Pesticide Science (J. Vontas) compared the expression of candidate detoxification genes in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> larvae exposed to two insecticides and three pollutants commonly found in\r\npolluted environments.  This study allowed the isolation of genes that are induced by distinct subsets of insecticides and pollutants (e.g. <a href="http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/ExpressionData/gene/AAEL001807">AAEL001807/CYP9M9 is induced by atrazin, permethrin and fluoranthen</a> while <a href="http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/ExpressionData/gene/AAEL009127">AAEL009127/CYP6M11 responds to copper sulfate</a>). Results of this research work will contribute to decode the molecular mechanisms of xenobiotic response in mosquitoes and the possible impact of pollutants on insecticide tolerance. This study will be published shortly in the journal Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology as (Poupardin et al., 2008).  The expression data is available in VectorBase from today.
