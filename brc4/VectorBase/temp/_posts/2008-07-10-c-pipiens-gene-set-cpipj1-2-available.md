title: C. pipiens gene set CpipJ1.2 available

An update to the <i>Culex pipiens</i> gene set, CpipJ1.2, is now available at <a href="/organisms/culex-quinquefasciatus">VectorBase</a>. Changes from the CpipJ1.1 set involved rectifying some issues with start and stop codons for 87 predictions and the removal of approx. 1,500 predictions which are not thought to represent real gene predictions. These are mostly small 1-2 exon models with no orthologs to any other species. This process involved extensive manual appraisal of prediction in tandem with bioinformatic approaches looking at potential bacterial and transposon-related  sequences.
