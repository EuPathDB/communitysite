VectorBase will soon be updating its Genome Browser to stay in line with the Ensembl code, and benefit from their constant improvements. You can familiarise yourself with the new genome browser via the Ensembl Genome links below. These changes are scheduled for release in early June. Please note that, from June, the VectorBase-hosted genome browser will have enhanced functionality (e.g. expression data, useful DAS tracks configured by default).
The hope that the new presentation is more intuitive and accessible. We will help you go through the change with a new tutorial and will be answering questions on our <a href="mailto: info@vectorbase.org"> HELP </a> mailing list. The web addresses won't change so any links you bookmarked will still be valid.
