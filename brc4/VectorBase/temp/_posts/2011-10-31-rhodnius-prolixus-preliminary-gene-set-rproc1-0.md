title: Rhodnius prolixus preliminary gene set RproC1.0
created: 1320120000
---
A preliminary 0.5 data set for <a href="/organisms/rhodnius-prolixus"><em>Rhodnius prolixus</em></a> is included in the VB-2011-10 release: 
<br><br>At the present time, the following data are available:
<ul> 
<li> repeats (Dust, TRF, known repeated elements publicly available)</li>
<li> alignments to 9,665 <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from dbEST mapped to the genome</li>
<li> alignments to 792,023 sequences from 2 <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> RNA-seq datasets mapped to the genome</li>
<li> alignments to 143,631 proteins from <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, grouped into 7 taxa, mapped to the genome</li>
<li> 18,426 <a href="http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html">Genscan</a> and 65,946 <a href="http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/software.html">SNAP</a> <em>ab intio</em> gene models</li>
<li> 15,878 gene models from the Lagerblad lab</li>
<li> consensus gene set with 20,976 genes and 32,624 transcripts built with the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/genome_annotation.html">Ensembl gene build pipeline</a> </li>
</ul><br><br>Be aware that the gene, transcript and peptide identifiers are not stable and there is no plan to maintain them. <br><br>They have not been indexed as part of the site-wide search. <br><br>Note that VectorBase provides a <a href="/blast">BLAST server</a>  to compare your sequence against the <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> supercontigs. <br><br>Gene annotation is available in GFF3 and GTF for <a href="/downloads/">download</a>, as are the transcripts, peptides, supercontigs and ESTs. <br><br>An enhanced genebuild will follow in a future VectorBase release.  We aim to reduce the high number of transcripts.
