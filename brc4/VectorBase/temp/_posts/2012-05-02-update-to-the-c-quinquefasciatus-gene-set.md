title: Update to the C. quinquefasciatus gene set
created: 1336017600
---
<p>The <b>Culex gene set (CpipJ1.3) been updated</b>, with integration of over 1,200 community submitted models. A small proportion of them (72) are new models, the rest being improvements to existing gene models. The total numbers of protein coding genes for this species is about 19,000. More details on the gene content on our <a href="/organisms/culex-quinquefasciatus/johannesburg-jhb/CpipJ1.3">Gene set page</a>.</p>
<p>As well as updating the gene set, we also re-ran the Xrefs, linking genes to external databases, and the Compara pipeline, updating the ortholog/paralog relationships with the other VectorBase species and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.</p>
<p>The gene set is displayed via the genome browser and fasta files are downloadable from the <a href="/downloads/">here</a>.</p>
