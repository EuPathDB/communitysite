title: Updated Rhodnius prolixus gene set
created: 1337140800
---
<p>An enhanced gene build for <a href="/organisms/rhodnius-prolixus"><em>Rhodnius prolixus</em></a> has been included as part of the VB-2012-04 release.  The high number of transcripts has been reduced.</p>
At the present time, the following data are available:
<ul>
<li>repeats (Dust, TRF, known repeated elements publicly available)</li>
<li>alignments to 9,665 <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from dbEST mapped to the genome</li>
<li>alignments to 792,023 sequences from 2 <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> RNA-seq datasets mapped to the genome</li>
<li>alignments to 143,631 proteins from <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, grouped into 7 taxa, mapped to the genome</li>
<li>549 ncRNAs and 1,148 pseudogenes have been predicted</li>
<li>18,426 <a href="http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html">Genscan</a> and 65,946 <a href="http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/software.html">SNAP</a> ab intio gene models</li>
<li>15,878 gene models from the Lagerblad lab</li>
<li>2,589 full length cDNAs from the Lagerblad lab</li>
<li>consensus gene set with 16,122 genes and  16,134 transcripts built with the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/genome_annotation.html">Ensembl gene build pipeline</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that the gene, transcript and peptide identifiers are not stable and\r\nthere is no plan to maintain them.  They have been indexed as part of the site-wide search.</p>
<p>Note that VectorBase provides a <a href="/blast/">BLAST service</a> to compare your sequence against the <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> supercontigs, transcripts and peptides.</p>
