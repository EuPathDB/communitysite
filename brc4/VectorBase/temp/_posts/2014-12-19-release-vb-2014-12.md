We are pleased to announce the December release of VectorBase (VB-2014-12):

<ul> 
<li>The expression database has been "spring cleaned" to improve consistency of p-values. It also now has ontology-enhanced search.</li> 
<li>Population Biology - several projects have been updated to improve data consistency and/or search.</li> 
<li>Gene sets have been updated this release for: Rhodnius prolixus, Glossina austeni, Glossina brevipalpis, Glossina fuscipes and Glossina pallidipes</li> 
<li>NewRNAseq sets have been added for: Lutzomyia longipalpis (x8), Glossina austeni (x2), Musca domestica (x5) and Biomphalaria glabrata (x8)</li>
<li>146 Anopheles gambiae RNA genes that lacked external references were associated with Rfam and/or mirBase identifiers. Statistics on the coverage of pairwise alignments are now available.</li>
<li>The Blastx genomic similarity search against the combined VectorBase proteome that was initially created for use in Web Apollo is now also displayed in VectorBase. The data can be viewed as a track in the genome browser via the "protein alignments" section of the display configuration.</li> 
</ul>
