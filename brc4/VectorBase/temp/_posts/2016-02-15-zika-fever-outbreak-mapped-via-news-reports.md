The HealthMap project collates news reports about disease outbreaks and where possible maps them to a geolocation. This is an automated process which aims to provide a unified view of the current state of an outbreak. The <a href="http://www.healthmap.org/zika/#timeline">Zika fever</a> map is now available.
