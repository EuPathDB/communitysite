<li>We have introduced a new Export feature, called Export STRUCTURE, to enhance Search functionality, for which the exported CSV file can be used with the STRUCTURE software.</li>

<li>This can be done through the renovated Export (button) in the Search page where Export Download, Sequence, and STRUCTURE are available in the popup window.</li>

<li>Please note that one needs to first select Population Biology (Domain) and Sample genotype (Sub-domain) from the Filter Results in order to activate Export STRUCTURE function (button). </li>

<li>You can try this feature with <em>Aedes aegypti</em> microsatellite data</li>
