We are pleased to announce the April 2019 release of VectorBase (VB-2019-04):
<ul>
<li>New species <i>Leptotrombidium deliense</i> - host vector for scrub typhus. Full details this mite genome are available in the publication 
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/12/giy127/5160133">"Genomes of trombidid mites reveal novel predicted allergens and laterally transferred genes associated with secondary metabolism." </a> Dong et al, Gigasciene 2018.</li>
<li>In this release there were updates to the gene sets for 4 species based on community annotation ( <i>
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/aedes-aegypti">Aedes aegypti</a>,
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-arabiensis">An. arabiensis</a>,
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-farauti">An. farauti</a>,  and
<a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/anopheles-gambiae">An. gambiae</a>.
 </i>).
<li>New summary tracks have been added in Apollo as a concise compilation of all splice site predictions from our aligned RNA-Seq data. There are two main types of tracks: one "known" (contain splice junctions in accord with the gene model) and several "unknown" (those come with various coverage threshold). Each species also has a merged bigwig file for the coverage.</li>
<li>The variation mart for SNP and indel data will be retired from this release as originally announced in the <a href="/release/release-vb-2018-10">October 2018</a> release notes. The variation BioMart has been replaced with the variation search facility which is described in this <a href="/tutorials/tools-and-resources-tutorials/variation"><u>tutorial</u></a>.</li>
<li>There is a new view in the PopBio map that visualizes the <a href="/popbio/map/?view=meal">blood meal hosts of vectors</a>.</li>
<li>Lots of new Population Biology data, including mosquito surveillance <a href="/popbio/map/?species=genus%20Aedes&view=abnd&zoom_level=14&center=41.61544232468112,-93.63965034484865&summarizeBy=Species&markerID=9zmkty&panelID=swarm-plots&grid=true&shared_link=true&limitTerms=true&optimizeColors=true&navDates=189302400000,1412121600000&resolution=Yearly">data from Iowa going back to the 1970s</a></li>
<li>The Genotype Explorer application will be retired in the next (June 2019) VectorBase release.</li>
<li>New tutorials includes these six topics: <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/webinar-tour"><u>Tour</u></a>, <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/webinar-aedes-and-culex"><u><em>Aedes</em> & <em>Culex</em></u></a>, <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/webinar-genome-browser"><u>Genome Browser</u></a> (includes 6 videos/demos), <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/webinar-anopheles"><u><em>Anopheles</em></u></a>, <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/webinar-query-and-browse"><u>Query & Browse</u></a> (Search, BioMart, BLAST, Clustal, Hmmer -includes 6 videos/demos) and <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/workshops/webinar-biomphalaria"><u><em>Biomphalaria</em></u></a>.</li>
</ul>
