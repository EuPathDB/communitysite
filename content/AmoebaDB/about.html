    <b>General Information</b><br><br>AmoebaDB belongs to the <a href="http://www.eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a> family of databases and is an integrated genomic and functional genomic database for <i>Entamoeba</i> and <i>Acanthamoeba</i> parasites.  In its first iteration (released in early 2010), AmoebaDB contains the genomes of three <i>Entamoeba</i> species (see below).  
AmoebaDB integrates whole genome sequence and annotation and will rapidly expand to include experimental data and environmental isolate sequences 
provided by community researchers . The database includes supplemental bioinformatics analyses and a web interface for data-mining.
<br><br>

    <b>Scientific Advisory Team</b><br><br>EuPathDB databases rely heavily on community input.  Each project in EuPathDB benefits from the advice and mentoring of members from each specific community. 
We hold monthly organism calls for each of our databases with members of the scientific advisory teams and others from the community.  
Anyone interested in joining one of these conference calls is encouraged to contact us.  
<!-- While monthly conference calls for AmoebaDB are already underway, 
a specific scientific advisory team as not yet been assembled. --></td></tr></table>
