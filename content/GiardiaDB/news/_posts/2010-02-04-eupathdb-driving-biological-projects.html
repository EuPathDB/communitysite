The NIAID-funded Eukaryotic Pathogen Genome Database
(<a href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB.org</a>) invites proposals for Driving Biological
Projects (DBPs) focused on one or more of the eukaryotic
pathogens supported by this Bioinformatics Resource Center
(BRC). We anticipate making two awards of up to $600K each
by July 1, 2010 (a second round of solicitations is expected
in 2012).<i> A two page Letter of Intent (LOI) is due Feb 28,
following which full applications will be solicited by
invitation only, with a deadline of March 31.</i>
