The ApiDB team is pleased to announce the release of ToxoDB 4.3
<br><br>
<u>New features include:</u>
<ul>
<li> Gene ID queries allow users to query with the identifiers from the predicted gene models.
<li> Graphic of the alternate gene predictions is now on the gene record page.
<li> View and download multiple sequence alignments between the sequenced strains with polymorphisms highlighted.
<li> Clustered and assembled ESTs are now available from the EST queries / pages and aligned to the genome (GBrowse).
<li> Additional Mass Spec data has been loaded.
<li> All BLAST queries have been consolidated to a single interface.
<li> Faster rendering of gene pages and GBrowse.
<li> Querying with a single identifier goes directly to the gene page rather than the summary results page.
<li> More convenient access to help ... please click the "Ask us a Question" link on the left of every page, or the "Contact Us" at bottom to report problems or suggest improvements to the database.
</ul>
