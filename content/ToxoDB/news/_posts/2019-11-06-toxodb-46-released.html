      <h3><b>New data in ToxoDB 46</b></h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <h4>Genome Annotation</h4>
		Genome annotation appears for the first time in ToxoDB for the following genomes. 
         <ul>
           <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_3b71c59a12"><i>Toxoplasma gondii </i>strain CAST</a> &mdash;

	   <h4>Proteomics</h4>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_8ab03f0b79">Mouse brain bradyzoite proteomics time course</a> &mdash;
               Proteomic analysis of bradyzoites purified from mouse brain cysts at 21 days, 28 days, 3 months, 4 months and 5 months post infection.  
			   <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/9dd84566-1663-49a2-ab52-a359b9aa4224/v1" target="_blank">Garfoot et al. Preprint</a><br><br>

			   And a similar study by the same authors produced HostDB RNA seq: 	<a href="https://hostdb.org/host/app/record/dataset/DS_7184e7fdbf">Mouse brain bradyzoite transcriptomes at 28, 90, 120 days post infection</a>.<br><br>

               Proteomic analysis of bradyzoites purified from mouse brain cysts at 21 days, 28 days, 3 months, 4 months and 5 months post infection.

	   <h4>RNA Sequence</h4>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_7eee2cd55f">Mouse brain bradyzoite transcriptomes at 28, 90, 120 days post infection</a> &mdash;
               Transcriptome of bradyzoites from mouse brain cysts via RNA sequence at 28, 90 and 120 days post-infection.  
			   <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30858341" target="_blank">Garfoot et al. 2019</a>.   <br><br>
			   Also available from this study are ToxoDB proteomics (<a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_8ab03f0b79">Mouse brain bradyzoite proteomics time course</a>) 
			   and Quantitative proteomics (<a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_c3d46a8b93">Mouse brain bradyzoite proteomics time course - quantitative</a>)
               A similar study by the same authors produced HostDB RNA seq: 	<a href="https://hostdb.org/host/app/record/dataset/DS_7184e7fdbf">Mouse transcriptome during early and late chronic infection with T. gondii</a>.
           </li>
         </ul>
	   <h4>Spacial Proteomics - hyperLOPIT</h4>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_eda79f81b5">Hyper LOPIT Global mapping of protein subcellular location</a> &mdash;
               HyperLOPIT spacial proteomics was used to simultaneously capture the steady-state subcellular association of thousands of proteins in the apicomplexan <i>Toxoplasma</i>.
			   Provided pre-publication from the lab of Ross Waller, University of Cambridge <a href="https://proteome.shinyapps.io/toxolopittzex/">author website for LOPIT analysis</a>.  
			   A data specific search is available (Search for genes, Protein targeting and localization, Localization by LOPIT Mass Spec).  The Protein targeting and localization 
			   section of gene pages contains a table that displays probabilities that the protein is localized in each of 26 cellular compartments, based on LOPIT analysis.

      <h3><b>New features in ToxoDB 46</b></h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
         <ul>
           <li>
             Copy Number Variation Pipeline Bug Fix:  To correct skewed copy number predictions, we changed the method for counting reads in our 
			 CNV pipeline from Cufflinks to HTSeq-Count.  In our new pipeline we calculate FPKM manually.  Please note - saved strategies 
			 that include CNV searches will likely produce different results in Release 46. 
           </li>
		   <li>
             Our pipeline of genomic analyses includes open reading frame (ORF) prediction in addition to loading gene models from the official annotation.  
			 Because data usage analysis showed low ORF usage, in our next release (47) predicted ORFs will be available as a genome-scale fasta file from 
			 our downloads section and removed  from the searches and genome browser.  Please <a href="https://eupathdb.org/eupathdb/app/contact-us" target ="_blank"> Contact Us</a> 
			 with questions or suggestions.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
