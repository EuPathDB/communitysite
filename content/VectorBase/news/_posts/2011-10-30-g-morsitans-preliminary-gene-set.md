The <i>Glossina morsitans</i> 0.5 gene set is now available!
<br><br>
This is our first gene set was generated by <a href="http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html">MAKER</a>. Input gene models are issues from species specific EST and RNA-seq alignments, Metazoa protein alignments, and <i>ab initio</i> programs. The community is currently assessing it and we hope to come up with a new, improved, gene set soon!\r\n<br><br>
While this gene set is not downloadable, it is accessible on the <a href="/organisms/glossina-morsitans">genome browser</a> or for <a href="/blast">blasting</a>.
<br><br>
Note that this is a TEMPORARY gene set, it is not searchable and won't be archived. We are not planning on maintaining identifiers and recommend using locations as well as identifiers to identify genes
<br><br>
Happy  <i>Glossina</i> browsing!
