<h3>Annotating features</h3>
<ul> 
<li>From either the right hand side or letf hand side menus, you can slect the draggable tracks. These tracks contain both the official gene set and the combined RNAseq evidence.</li>        
<li>Click-and-drag features to the User-created annotations or right click features and select "Create new annotation".</li> 
        
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"> <p></p><center><a href="/assets/images/Apollo1.png"><img  src="{{ "/assets/images/Apollo1.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" width="" /></a></center>
        
        <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"> <p></p><center><a href="/assets/images/Apollo2.png"><img  src="{{ "/assets/images/Apollo2.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" width="" /></a></center>
     
<li> Use "edge matching" function, shown as red highlight, to match exon boundaries to evidence from gene models or alignments.</li> 
<li>Use "Color by CDS" to highlight the calculated translation frame for annotations and evidence features.</li> 
<li>Add details for each annotation using the "Information Editor" dialog.
</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Move the view by clicking and dragging in the track area, or by clicking or in the navigation bar, or by pressing the left and right arrow keys.</li> 
<li>Center the view at a point by clicking on either the track scale bar or overview bar, or by shift-clicking in the track area.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Zooming</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Zoom in and out by clicking or in the navigation bar, or by pressing the up and down arrow keys while holding down "shift".</li> 
<li>Select a region and zoom to it ("rubber-band" zoom) by clicking and dragging in the overview or track scale bar, or shift-clicking and dragging in the track area.</li> 
</ul>
        
        
<h3>Searching</h3>
<ul> 
<li> Jump to a feature or reference sequence by typing its name in the location box and pressing Enter.</li> 
<li>Jump to a specific region by typing the region into the location box as: ref:start..end.</li> 
</ul>
         
<h3>Annotation shortcuts</h3>
<ul> 
<li>Use [ and ] to jump between splice sites in a given annotation on the User-created annotation area.</li> 
<li>Use { and } to jump to the nearest gene on the User-created annotation area.</li> 
<li>Select a feature in the User-created annotation area and press alt-click to quickly reach the "Information editor". </li> 
</ul>
