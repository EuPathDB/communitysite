  <p>The Eukaryotic Pathogen, Vector & Host Informatics Resources (http://VEuPathDB.org)
    is a Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) operated under contract from the US National Institute of Allergy and 
    Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Wellcome Trust. VEuPathDB is charged with ensuring that genomic (and other 
    large-scale) datasets pertaining to supported pathogens are conveniently accessible to the worldwide community of 
    biomedical researchers. This document summarizes policies associated with releasing datasets on VEuPathDB. 
    Our goal is to help the communities that we serve ensure that their data are FAIR, Findable, Accessible, 
    Interoperable and Reusable.
  </p>
  
  <p>VEuPathDB welcomes submissions of genomic-scale data concerning eukaryotic microbes, fungi, vectors of human disease, 
    and host-pathogen interactions. The VEuPathDB contract from NIAID provides support for biosecurity pathogens, including 
    <i>Babesia</i>, <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, <i>Entamoeba</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, <i>Microsporidi</i>a (various genera), 
    <i>Toxoplasma</i>, <i>Plasmodium</i>, and related taxa (<i>Acanthamoeba</i>, <i>Gregarina</i>, <i>Neospora</i>, 
    <i>Theileria</i>) and also arthropod vectors (ticks, mites, mosquitoes, kissing bugs, tsetse flies, sand flies, 
    lice, etc.) of human disease, as well as a sail that serves as an intermediate host, and comparator species. 
    Support for kinetoplastid parasites (<i>Crithidia</i>, <i>Endotrypanum</i>, <i>Leishmania</i>, <i>Trypanosoma</i>) 
    is provided by The Wellcome Trust. The FungiDB project encompasses a large (and growing) number of species supported 
    by both NIAID and the Wellcome Trust. Please contact us if you have data from other species that should be 
    incorporated into VEuPathDB! <b>Please review our
    <a href="{{ "/assets/documents/VEuPathDB_Data_Sub_Release_policy_rev_02April2020.pdf" | absolute_url }}">Data Submission Policy</a></b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>Our most common data types include transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, population-level and isolate 
     information. In one form or another, VEuPathDB currently represents datasets in the following categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>sequence (genomic [nuclear and organellar],</li>
    <li>ESTs and RNA-seq, generated on various platforms),</li>
    <li>host-response data,</li>
    <li>comparative genomic information,</li>
    <li>DNA polymorphism and population genetics data,</li> 
    <li>sequences and metadata pertaining to field and clinical isolates and collections (with geo-spatiotemporal and other metadata),</li> 
    <li>chromatin modification data (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq),</li> 
    <li>manually curated and automatically generated gene models and other annotation (GO terms, InterPro domains, etc.),</li>
    <li>transcript and proteomic profiling,</li>
    <li>host response data sets (multiple platforms),</li>
    <li>interactome data,</li>
    <li>protein structural information,</li>
    <li>metabolic pathways and metabolomics data,</li>
    <li>phenotype information, reagents (clones, antibodies, etc.),</li>
    <li>publication references,</li>
    <li>image data, etc.</li> 
  </ul>

  <p>We also accept other genomic-scale data and are open to suggestions. Use the <a href="/a/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a> link to make suggestions. We look 
   forward to working with you!

<h3>How to submit data for integration in VEuPathDB</h3>

  <p>To submit your data for integration, fill out the appropriate VEuPathDB Dataset nomination form listed below. If your data 
    cannot be submitted via our forms, use the <a href="/a/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">Contact Us</a> 
    link to send a brief description (two or three sentences) of your data.
  </p>

  <p>Genomes & high throughput sequencing data (e.g. RNA-Seq, ChiP-Seq, isolates typed by Whole Genome Sequencing or by 
    sequencing limited genetic loci) must be available in The 
    International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) such as NCBI GenBank, EMBL-EBI ENA or DDBJ.</p>
    Once the dataset is prioritised for loading, we will export the data directly from INSDC. Note: while genome sequences 
    must be available in INSDC, functional annotation (e.g. gene names, GO terms, etc.) can be submitted directly to VEuPathDB.
  </p>

  <p>Tell us about your data as early as possible, to allow ample time for scheduling into VEuPathDB release cycles. 
    Depending on the dataset type, we can provide instructions on how to transfer your data to us (e.g. formats of proteomics 
    datasets may differ depending on the nature and scale of the data to be transferred), or we may be able to facilitate data 
    submission to a repository (e.g. GenBank, GEO/ArrayExpress, etc.).
  </p>

  <p>VectorBase resource: Gene manual annotations (change of exon-intron boundaries, creation of new genes) and metadata 
    (gene names/symbols and functional description) can be submitted via Apollo (follow this link). If you submit a gene ]
    annotation before you submit a manuscript for publication, we can generate GeneIDs that can be linked out to within the 
    publication. Gene deletions are not handled via Apollo, please <a href="/a/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">Contact Us</a> with supporting evidence. 
    Metadata can also be submitted by sending a spreadsheet file for batch submissions, follow this link for information about 
    the 12 columns heading that are required. To add publications to a gene send us the corresponding PubMed link.
