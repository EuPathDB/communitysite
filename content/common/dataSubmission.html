<h1>How to submit data to us</h1>
<p>VEuPathDB welcomes submissions of genomic-scale data concerning eukaryotic pathogens and host-pathogen
interactions. <a href="/EuPathDB_datasubm_SOP.pdf"> Please review our Data Submission Policy</a>. </p>

<p>Our most common data types include transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, population-level and isolate 
information. In one form or another, VEuPathDB currently represents datasets in the following categories:
   <ul>  
<li>sequence data (genomes, ESTs, RNA-seq, generated on various platforms),</li>
<li>comparative genomic information,</li>
<li>DNA polymorphism and population genetics data,</li>
<li>information on the field and clinical isolates and collections (with geo-spatiotemporal and other metadata),</li>
<li>chromatin modification data (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq),</li>
<li>manually curated and automatically generated gene models and other annotation (GO terms, InterPro domains, etc.),</li>
<li>transcript and proteomic profiling,</li>
<li>host response data sets (multiple platforms),</li>
<li>interactome data,</li>
<li>structural information,</li>
<li>metabolic pathways and metabolomics data,</li>
<li>phenotype information,</li>
<li>reagents (clones, antibodies, etc.),</li>
<li>publication references,</li>
<li>image data, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>We also accept other genomic-scale data and are open to suggestions. Use the <a href="/a/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a> link to make suggestions. We look 
forward to working with you!</p>
<h3>How to submit data for integration in VEuPathDB</h3>
<p>VEuPathDB can integrate a variety of datasets, including genomes & high throughput sequencing data (e.g. RNA-Seq, ChiP-Seq, 
isolates typed by Whole Genome Sequencing or by sequencing limited genetic loci). These dataset must be available in The 
International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) such as NCBI GenBank, EMBL-EBI ENA or DDBJ.
<br></br>
To submit your data for integration, fill out the appropriate VEuPathDB Dataset nomination form listed below or 
<a href="/a/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a> to submit other types of data. Once the dataset is prioritised for loading, 
we will export the data directly from INSDC.</p> 

<p>Please note that genome sequences must be available in INSDC, however functional annotation (e.g. gene names, GO terms, etc.)
can be submitted directly to VEuPathDB.</p>

<p>Tell us about your data as early as possible, to allow ample time for scheduling into VEuPathDB release cycles. 
Depending on the dataset type, we can provide instructions on how to transfer your data to us (e.g. formats of proteomics 
datasets may differ depending on the nature and scale of the data to be transferred), or we may be able to facilitate data 
submission to a repository (e.g. GenBank, GEO/ArrayExpress).</p>

<p>VectorBase resource: Gene manual annotations (change of exon-intron boundaries, creation of new genes) and metadata 
(gene names/symbols and functional description) can be submitted via Apollo (follow this link). If you submit a gene 
annotation before you submit a manuscript for publication, we can generate GeneIDs that can be linked out to within the 
publication. Gene deletions are not handled via Apollo, please contact the VectorBase team with supporting evidence. 
Metadata can also be submitted by sending a spreadsheet file for batch submissions, follow this link for information about 
the 12 columns heading that are required. To add publications to a gene send us the corresponding PubMed link.</p>       

<p><b>Data Submission Process:</b></p>


<p>Contact VEuPathDB Outreach for an initial review of your data.</b> </p>

<p>Use the <a
href="/a/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">Contact Us</a> link to send a
brief description (two or three sentences) of your data. We will make every
effort to reply quickly. During the data submission process, data sets are scheduled
for an upcoming release and given a release date so that we can allocate our
resources appropriately. This release date is flexible. Data will not be made
available to anyone, used for any other purpose or be made public until you, 
the data provider, are satisfied that releasing the data is
appropriate and the data representation is accurate.
