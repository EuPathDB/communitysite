<h3>BLAST<sup><i>beta</i></sup></h3>

<p>BLAST finds regions of similarity between biological sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches.  Input a single sequence or several fasta-formatted sequences at once.  </p>

<p>Our tool uses the <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" target="_blank">NCBI BLAST program</a> to find genes, genomic sequences, ESTs, or PopSet Sequences that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence. The tool accomodates up to 100 sequences of up to 100,000 amino acids or 1 million nucleotides. Each 'job' you submit is logged in your 'My Jobs' page and remains available indefinitely. Jobs run on multiple sequences include results in two formats:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Combined Result - a nonredundant list of all sequences with similarity to your input sequence</li>
    <li>Individual Result - categorized lists of sequences with similarity to your input sequence.  One list per input sequence.  </li>
</ul>
<br>
All results can be downloaded in your choice of several formats, and individual results can be exported as a search strategy for further data mining in VEuPathDB.
