<div class="static-content">

<p>UPDATED: May 23, 2018</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>VEuPathDB (also referred to as ‘we’ throughout this document) is committed to protecting its users’ data and privacy. The purpose of this page is to provide you with information about how the data we collect from users of VEuPathDB websites is used or shared. We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. We encourage you to visit this page frequently and take note of the date updated field above.</p>
<p>We do not use or share any of your personal information for any purpose unrelated to the functionality of the websites; however, we do collect some information to help us understand how our sites are being used in order to improve community support and to enhance the VEuPathDB community’s experience when visiting our sites.</p>
<h2 id="information-automatically-collected">Information Automatically Collected</h2>
<p>When you browse VEuPathDB sites, certain information about your visit will be collected. We automatically collect and store the following type of information about your visit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The IP address of the client making the request. Often the IP address is that of your personal computer or smart phone; however, it might be that of a firewall or proxy your internet provider manages.</p></li>
<li><p>The operating system and information about the browser used when visiting the site.</p></li>
<li><p>The date and time of each visit.</p></li>
<li><p>Pages visited.</p></li>
<li><p>The address of a referring page. If you click a link on a website that directs you to a VEuPathDB page, the address of that originating web page will be collected. This “referrer” information is transmitted as part of the browser and server communications; it is not based on any marketing or partnering agreements with the referring site.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This automatically collected information does not identify you personally unless you include personally identifying information in a support form request; see the “Contact Us” policy below for details. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site. The aggregate data may be included in prospectuses and reports to funding agencies.</p>
<h2 id="information-you-directly-provide">Information You Directly Provide</h2>
<p>The Basket, Favorites, Public Strategies, Gene/Sequence Comment and GBrowse Track features of the VEuPathDB websites require that you register for an account. A valid email address is required so we can send you your temporary account password. An anonymous email service can be used if you do not want to provide personally identifying information.</p>
<p>Your email address will be used to send you infrequent alerts if you subscribe to receive them. We do not sell or distribute email addresses to third parties.</p>
<p>We also ask for your name and institution during account registration. If you add a comment to a Gene or a Sequence, your name and institution will be displayed with the comment. If you make one of your strategies public, your name and institution will be displayed with it. We do not routinely verify the validity of names and institutions associated with comments or public strategies; however, we will delete accounts or comments if we believe them to be fraudulent based on inappropriate activity or posted content. We will not sell or distribute your name or institution to third parties.</p>
<p>When you log in, the client IP address is recorded. This IP address can be correlated with the address automatically collected as noted above. If your user profile personally identifies you, then it may be possible to associate you with your detailed activity on VEuPathDB web sites.</p>
<h3 id="contact-us-form">“Contact Us” Form</h3>
<p>The header on each web page includes a “Contact Us” link to a form where users can submit questions, error reports, feature requests, and dataset proposals. Submissions through this form are emailed to VEuPathDB staff and recorded in a project management application accessible only by VEuPathDB staff.</p>
<p>The form includes a field for an email address. If the email address identifies you personally, say if you use your institutional email, then your correspondence with us will likewise be linked to you. A valid email is not strictly required, although we cannot reply to you without one.</p>
<p>When you submit the form, your IP address and browser version will be recorded for internal use. In the case of reported bugs or other site errors, this information may be used by technical staff to help locate your session in the server logs to aid in troubleshooting the issue. This does have the side effect of making it possible to associate an IP address with an email address which may, in turn, personally identify you. However, VEuPathDB does not publicly release this information.</p>
<h2 id="how-eupathdb-uses-cookies">How VEuPathDB Uses Cookies</h2>
<p>VEuPathDB uses cookies to associate multiple requests by your web browser into a stateful session. Cookies are essential to track the state of query strategies, gene baskets and authentication.</p>
<p>Some cookies persist only for a single session. The information is recorded temporarily and is erased when the user quits the session or closes the browser. Others may be persistently stored on the hard drive of your computer until you manually delete them from a browser folder or until they expire, which can be months after they were last used.</p>
<p>Cookies can be disabled in your browser (refer to your browser’s documentation for instructions); however, the majority of the website functionality will be unavailable if cookies are disabled.</p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Google Analytics provides aggregate measurements of website traffic including counts of page hits and unique users along with statistics on countries of origin.</p>
<p>The raw measurements and statistics are only available to approved VEuPathDB staff. Aggregated data may be included in prospectuses and reports to funding agencies.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-websites-and-applications">Third-Party Websites and Applications</h2>
<p>Third-party websites and applications are not exclusively operated or controlled by VEuPathDB. By using these third-party websites, individuals may be providing nongovernmental third-parties with access to personally identifying information.</p>
