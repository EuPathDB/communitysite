==== Collections

Collections are groups of data or content that can be
injected into the templates in the <<Content>> directory.

Collections are directories grouped by type or purpose that
must exist at the root of the project with a directory name
beginning with an underscore character.

Additionally all collections must be registered in the
`_config.yml` file at the root of the project under the
block titled `collections:`.  Entries must match the name of
the collection directory minus the leading underscore.

.Example
[source, yaml]
----
collections:
  _collection_resources_tools:
----

`_collection_resources_tools/`::
  Collection of home page resources on cards, by default applicable to all sites

==== Content

----
content
â”œâ”€â”€ AmoebaDB
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ about.html
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ externalLinks.html
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ news.json
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ news.md
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ resources_tools.json
...
----

The content directory houses Liquid templates representing
the rendered html/json documents organized by project in
subdirectories.

If your goal is to add a new page/url to the site, a Liquid
template for that page should be added here for that page.

===== Common

A non-project directory containing globally used pages.

==== Data

Files that contain data such as site specific values for all projects or a list of exercise cards to show in home page. 
Template files in the Content directory might read these data, or the data might be use to generate site specific links using site speciifc project information such as a gene id or an example organism.

==== Documents

PDF files are stored here. Feel free to generate subdirectories for organization.

==== Images

Images are stored in assets/images.  Again feel free to generate subdirectories for organization.

==== News

----

        ...
----

Contains news entries organized by project.  These pages are
static content (containing no Liquid templating) and can be
written in either HTML or Markdown

== Frontmatter

See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/ for a detailed
explanation of Jekyll's front matter and what meta tags are
available.

.Example
[source, yaml, linenums]
----
---
title: Some content page
permalink: /PlasmoDB/something
tags: [tutorial, topic1, topic2]
---
# Liquid template goes here
----

=== Site Requirements

The following metadata is required in the front matter for
community site pages:

`permalink`::

This tells Jekyll the path that a given page should be
made available at in the generated site.  Content under
one of the project directories under `content/` should
include their project name in the permalink.  For example
`permalink: /ClinEpiDB/faq` tells Jekyll to mount this
page at `\http://{community-site-url}/ClinEpiDB/faq.html`.
+
The exceptions to this rule are the pages under the
`content/common` directory which are generally mounted
at the root of the site.

=== Site Search Requirements

In addition to the above front matter requirements, for a
page to be available in site search it must also contain
the following metadata:

`title`::

The page title is used when displaying search results or
creating a link to the page from search results.

`tags`::

Tags can be used to provide information about what topics
are on a page or what the page's purpose is, but site search
uses specific tags to determine a page's document type.  If
one of the known tags does not appear in a page's tags
metadata, the page will not be indexed.  The specific site
search tags are:
+
====
* `general`
* `tutorial`
* `news`
* `workshop-exercise`
====
+
Additionally, tags must be provided as an array in the form `[tag1, tag2, tag3]`.
